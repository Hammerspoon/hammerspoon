--- hs.hotkey.alertDuration
--- Variable
--- Duration of the alert shown when a hotkey created with a `message` parameter is triggered, in seconds. Default is 1.
---
--- Usage:
--- hs.hotkey.alertDuration = 2.5 -- alert stays on screen a bit longer

--- hs.hotkey:enable() -> hs.hotkey object | nil
--- Method

--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:

---
--- Notes:
---  * When you enable a hotkey that uses the same keyboard combination as another previously-enabled hotkey, the old

--- hs.hotkey.new(mods, key, [message,] pressedfn, releasedfn, repeatfn) -> hs.hotkey object
--- Constructor
--- Creates a new hotkey
---
--- Parameters:
---  * mods - A table or a string containing (as elements, or as substrings with any separator) the keyboard modifiers required,
---    which should be zero or more of the following:
---    * "cmd", "command" or "⌘"
---    * "ctrl", "control" or "⌃"
---    * "alt", "option" or "⌥"
---    * "shift" or "⇧"
---  * key - A string containing the name of a keyboard key (as found in [hs.keycodes.map](hs.keycodes.html#map) ), or a raw keycode number
---  * message - (optional) A string containing a message to be displayed via `hs.alert()` when the hotkey has been
---    triggered; if omitted, no alert will be shown
---  * pressedfn - A function that will be called when the hotkey has been pressed, or nil
---  * releasedfn - A function that will be called when the hotkey has been released, or nil
---  * repeatfn - A function that will be called when a pressed hotkey is repeating, or nil
---
--- Returns:
---  * A new `hs.hotkey` object or nil if the hotkey could not be enabled
---
--- Notes:
---  * You can create multiple `hs.hotkey` objects for the same keyboard combination, but only one can be active
---    at any given time - see `hs.hotkey:enable()`
---  * If `message` is the empty string `""`, the alert will just show the triggered keyboard combination
---  * If you don't want any alert, you must *actually* omit the `message` parameter; a `nil` in 3rd position
---    will be interpreted as a missing `pressedfn`
---  * You must pass at least one of `pressedfn`, `releasedfn` or `repeatfn`; to delete a hotkey, use `hs.hotkey:delete()`

--- hs.hotkey.systemAssigned(mods, key) -> table | false
--- Function
--- Examine whether a potential hotkey is in use by the macOS system such as the Screen Capture, Universal Access, and Keyboard Navigation keys.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * mods - A table or a string containing (as elements, or as substrings with any separator) the keyboard modifiers required,
---    which should be zero or more of the following:
---    * "cmd", "command" or "⌘"
---    * "ctrl", "control" or "⌃"
---    * "alt", "option" or "⌥"
---    * "shift" or "⇧"
---  * key - A string containing the name of a keyboard key (as found in [hs.keycodes.map](hs.keycodes.html#map) ), or a raw keycode number
---
--- Returns:
---  * if the hotkey combination is in use by a system function, returns a table containing the following keys:
---    * keycode - the numberic keycode for the hotkey
---    * mods    - a numeric representation of the modifier flags for the htokey
---    * enabled - a boolean indicating whether or not the key is currently enabled
---  * if the hotkey combination is not in use by the operating system, returns the boolean value `false`
---
--- Notes:
---  * this is provided for informational purposes and does not provide a reliable test as to whether or not Hammerspoon can use the combination to create a custom hotkey -- some combinations which return a table can be over-ridden by Hammerspoon while others cannot.  See also [hs.hotkey.assignable](#assignable).

--- hs.hotkey.assignable(mods, key) -> boolean
--- Function
--- Determines whether the hotkey combination can be assigned a callback through Hammerspoon.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * mods - A table or a string containing (as elements, or as substrings with any separator) the keyboard modifiers required,
---    which should be zero or more of the following:
---    * "cmd", "command" or "⌘"
---    * "ctrl", "control" or "⌃"
---    * "alt", "option" or "⌥"
---    * "shift" or "⇧"
---  * key - A string containing the name of a keyboard key (as found in [hs.keycodes.map](hs.keycodes.html#map) ), or a raw keycode number
---
--- Returns:
---  * a boolean value, true if the hotkey combination can be given an assignment by Hammerspoon or false if it cannot.
---
--- Notes:
---  * The most common reason a hotkey combination cannot be given an assignment by Hammerspoon is because it is in use by the Mac operating system -- see the Shortcuts tab of Keyboard in the System Preferences application or [hs.hotkey.systemAssigned](#systemAssigned).
