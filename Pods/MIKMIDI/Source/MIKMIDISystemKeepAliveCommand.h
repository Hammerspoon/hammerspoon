/**
 *  A MIDI System Keep Alive message (aka Active Sensing).
 *  Keep alive messages are sent repeatedly
 *  to tell the receiver of them that the MIDI connection is alive and working.
 *  Not all devices will send these at all.
 *
 *  Per the MIDI spec, if a device *does* receive a keep alive message, it should
 *  expect to receive another no more than 300 ms later. If it does not, it can
 *  assume the connection has been terminated, and turn off all currently active
 *  voices/notes.
 *
 *  Note that MIKMIDI doesn't (currently) implement this behavior at all, and it
 *  is up to MIKMIDI clients to implement it if so desired.
