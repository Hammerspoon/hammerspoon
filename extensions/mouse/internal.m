/// hs.mouse.getAbsolutePosition() -> point
/// Function
/// Gets the absolute co-ordinates of the mouse pointer
///
/// Parameters:
///  * None
///
/// Returns:
///  * A point-table containing the absolute x and y co-ordinates of the mouse pointer
///
/// Notes:
///  * The co-ordinates returned by this function are in relation to the full size of your desktop.
