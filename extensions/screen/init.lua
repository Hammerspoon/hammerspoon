--- === hs.screen ===
---
--- Manipulate screens (i.e. monitors)
---
--- You usually get a screen through a window (see `hs.window.screen`). But you can get screens by themselves through this module, albeit not in any defined/useful order.
---
--- Hammerspoon's coordinate system assumes a grid that is the union of every screen's rect (see `hs.screen.fullFrame`).
---
--- Every window's position (i.e. `topleft`) and size are relative to this grid, and they're usually within the grid. A window that's semi-offscreen only intersects the grid.

--- hs.screen.primaryScreen() -> screen
--- Constructor
--- Returns the primary screen, i.e. the one containing the menubar
function screen.primaryScreen()
  return screen.allScreens()[1]
end

--- hs.screen.findByName(name) -> screen or nil
--- Function
--- Finds a screen by its name
---
--- Parameters:
---  * name - A string containing the name to search for
---
--- Returns:
---  * An `hs.screen` object, or nil if none could be found
function screen.findByName(name)
  return fnutils.find(screen.allScreens(), function(display) return (display:name() == name) end)
end

--- hs.screen.findByID(id) -> screen or nil
--- Function
--- Finds a screen by its ID
---
--- Parameters:
---  * id - A number containing the ID to search for
---
--- Returns:
---  * An `hs.screen` object, or nil if none could be found
function screen.findByID(id)
  return fnutils.find(screen.allScreens(), function(display) return (display:id() == id) end)
end


--- hs.screen.screenPositions() -> table
--- Function
--- Return a list of all connected and enabled screens, along with their "position" relative to the primary screen
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * a table where each *key* is an `hs.screen` object, and the corresponding value is a table {x=X,y=Y}, where X and Y attempt to indicate
---    each screen's position relative to the primary screen (which is at {x=0,y=0}); so e.g. a value of {x=-1,y=0} indicates a screen immediately to
---    the left of the primary screen, and a value of {x=0,y=2} indicates a screen positioned below the primary screen, with another screen inbetween.
---
--- Notes:
---  * grid-like arrangements of same-sized screens should behave consistently; but there's no guarantee of a consistent result for more "exotic" screen arrangements

-- if/when userdata's __eq and/or 'recycling' is addressed, the following note can be added
-- Notes:
--  * To get a specific screen's position in the current layout, you can simply use `pos=hs.screen.screenLayout()[myscreen]`
