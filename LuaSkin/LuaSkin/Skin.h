/*! @methodgroup Registering module libraries with Lua */

/*!
 @abstract Defines a Lua library and creates a references table for the library
 @discussion Lua libraries defined in C are simple mappings between Lua function names and C function pointers.

 A library consists of a series of Lua functions that are exposed to the user, and (optionally) several special Lua functions that will be used by Lua itself. The most common of these is <tt>__gc</tt> which will be called when Lua is performing garbage collection for the library.
 These "special" functions are stored in the library's metatable. Other common metatable functions include <tt>__tostring</tt> and <tt>__index</tt>.

 The mapping between Lua functions and C functions is done using an array of type <tt>luaL_Reg</tt>

 Every C function pointed to in a <tt>luaL_Reg</tt> array must have the signature: <tt>static int someFunction(lua_State *L);</tt>

 Here is some sample code:
 <pre>@textblock
 static const luaL_Reg myShinyLibrary[] = {
    {"doThing", function_doThing},
    {NULL, NULL} // Library arrays must always end with this
 };

 static const luaL_Reg myShinyMetaLibrary[] = {
    {"__gc", function_doLibraryCleanup},
    {NULL, NULL} // Library arrays must always end with this
 };
