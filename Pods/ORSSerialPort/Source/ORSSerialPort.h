/**
 *  The ORSSerialPort class represents a serial port, and includes methods to
 *  configure, open and close a port, and send and receive data to and from
 *  a port.
 *
 *  There is a 1:1 correspondence between port devices on the
 *  system and instances of `ORSSerialPort`. That means that repeated requests
 *  for a port object for a given device or device path will return the same 
 *  instance of `ORSSerialPort`.
 *
 *  Opening a Port and Setting It Up
 *  --------------------------------
 *
 *  You can get an `ORSSerialPort` instance either of two ways. The easiest
 *  is to use `ORSSerialPortManager`'s `availablePorts` array. The other way
 *  is to get a new `ORSSerialPort` instance using the serial port's BSD device path:
 *
 *  	ORSSerialPort *port = [ORSSerialPort serialPortWithPath:@"/dev/cu.KeySerial1"];
 *
 *  Note that you must give `+serialPortWithPath:` the full path to the
 *  device, as shown in the example above.
 *
 *
 *  After you've got a port instance, you can open it with the `-open`
 *  method. When you're done using the port, close it using the `-close`
 *  method.
 *
 *  Port settings such as baud rate, number of stop bits, parity, and flow
 *  control settings can be set using the various properties `ORSSerialPort`
 *  provides. Note that all of these properties are Key Value Observing
 *  (KVO) compliant. This KVO compliance also applies to read-only
 *  properties for reading the state of the CTS, DSR and DCD pins. Among
 *  other things, this means it's easy to be notified when the state of one
 *  of these pins changes, without having to continually poll them, as well
 *  as making them easy to connect to a UI with Cocoa bindings.
 *
 *  Sending Data
 *  ------------
 *
 *  Send data by passing an `NSData` object to the `-sendData:` method:
 *
 *  	NSData *dataToSend = [self.sendTextField.stringValue dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
 *  	[self.serialPort sendData:dataToSend];
 *
 *  Receiving Data
 *  --------------
 *
 *  To receive data, you must implement the `ORSSerialPortDelegate`
 *  protocol's `-serialPort:didReceiveData:` method, and set the
 *  `ORSSerialPort` instance's delegate property. As noted in the documentation
 *  for ORSSerialPortDelegate, this method is always called on the main queue.
 *  An example implementation is included below:
 *
 *  	- (void)serialPort:(ORSSerialPort *)serialPort didReceiveData:(NSData *)data
 *  	{
 *  		NSString *string = [[NSString alloc] initWithData:data encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
 *  		[self.receivedDataTextView.textStorage.mutableString appendString:string];
 *  		[self.receivedDataTextView setNeedsDisplay:YES];
 *  	}
