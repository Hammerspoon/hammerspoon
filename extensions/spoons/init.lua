--- hs.spoons.scriptPath([n]) -> string
--- Method
--- Return path of the current spoon.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * n - (optional) stack level for which to get the path. Defaults to 2, which will return the path of the spoon which called `scriptPath()`
---
--- Returns:
---  * String with the path from where the calling code was loaded.

end

--- hs.spoons.resourcePath(partial) -> string
--- Method
--- Return full path of an object within a spoon directory, given its partial path.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * partial - path of a file relative to the Spoon directory. For example `images/img1.png` will refer to a file within the `images` directory of the Spoon.
---
--- Returns:
---  * Absolute path of the file. Note: no existence or other checks are done on the path.
function module.resourcePath(partial)
   return(module.scriptPath(3) .. partial)
end

--- hs.spoons.bindHotkeysToSpec(def, map) -> none
--- Method
--- Map a number of hotkeys according to a definition table
---
--- Parameters:
---  * def - table containing name-to-function definitions for the hotkeys supported by the Spoon. Each key is a hotkey name, and its value must be a function that will be called when the hotkey is invoked.
---  * map - table containing name-to-hotkey definitions, as supported by [bindHotkeys in the Spoon API](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/blob/master/SPOONS.md#hotkeys). Not all the entries in `def` must be bound, but if any keys in `map` don't have a definition, an error will be produced.
---
--- Returns:
---  * None
function module.bindHotkeysToSpec(def,map)
   local spoonpath = module.scriptPath(3)
   for name,key in pairs(map) do
      if def[name] ~= nil then

      else
         log.ef("Error: Hotkey requested for undefined action '%s'", name)
      end
   end
end

--- hs.spoons.list() -> table
--- Method
--- Return a list of installed/loaded Spoons
---
--- Parameters:
---  * onlyLoaded - only return loaded Spoons (skips those that are installed but not loaded). Defaults to `false`
---
--- Returns:
---  * Table with a list of installed/loaded spoons (depending on the value of `onlyLoaded`). Each entry is a table with the following entries:
---    * `name` - Spoon name
---    * `loaded` - boolean indication of whether the Spoon is loaded (`true`) or only installed (`false`)
---    * `version` - Spoon version number. Available only for loaded Spoons.

   local _, dirobj = fs.dir(configdir .. "/Spoons")

          if f then

                local s = f:gsub(".spoon$", "")
                local l = (spoon[s] ~= nil)
                if (not onlyLoaded) or l then
                   local new = { name = s, loaded = l }
                   if l then new.version = spoon[s].version end
                   table.insert(res, new)
                end
             end
          end

    end

end

--- hs.spoons.isInstalled(name) -> table | nil
--- Method
--- Check if a given Spoon is installed.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * name - Name of the Spoon to check.
---
--- Returns:
---  * If the Spoon is installed, it returns a table with the Spoon information as returned by `list()`. Returns `nil` if the Spoon is not installed.
function module.isInstalled(name)
   local list = module.list()
   for _,v in ipairs(list) do
      if v.name == name then
         return v
      end
   end
   return nil
end

--- hs.spoons.isLoaded(name) -> boolean | nil
--- Method
--- Check if a given Spoon is loaded.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * name - Name of the Spoon to check.
---
--- Returns:
---  * `true` if the Spoon is loaded, `nil` otherwise.
function module.isLoaded(name)
   local list = module.list()
   for _,v in ipairs(list) do
      if v.name == name then
         return v.loaded
      end
   end
   return nil
end

--- hs.spoons.use(name, arg) -> boolean | nil
--- Method
--- Declaratively load and configure a Spoon
---
--- Parameters:
---  * name - the name of the Spoon to load (without the `.spoon` extension).
---  * arg - if provided, can be used to specify the configuration of the Spoon. The following keys are recognized (all are optional):
---    * config - a table containing variables to be stored in the Spoon object to configure it. For example, `config = { answer = 42 }` will result in `spoon.<LoadedSpoon>.answer` being set to 42.
---    * hotkeys - a table containing hotkey bindings. If provided, will be passed as-is to the Spoon's `bindHotkeys()` method. The special string `"default"` can be given to use the Spoons `defaultHotkeys` variable, if it exists.
---    * fn - a function which will be called with the freshly-loaded Spoon object as its first argument.
---    * loglevel - if the Spoon has a variable called `logger`, its `setLogLevel()` method will be called with this value.
---    * start - if `true`, call the Spoon's `start()` method after configuring everything else.
---  * noerror - if `true`, don't log an error if the Spoon is not installed, simply return `nil`.
---
--- Returns:
---  * `true` if the spoon was loaded, `nil` otherwise
