--- === hs.canvas ===
---
--- A different approach to drawing in Hammerspoon
---
--- `hs.drawing` approaches graphical images as independant primitives, each "shape" being a separate drawing object based on the core primitives: ellipse, rectangle, point, line, text, etc.  This model works well with graphical elements that are expected to be managed individually and don't have complex clipping interactions, but does not scale well when more complex combinations or groups of drawing elements need to be moved or manipulated as a group, and only allows for simple inclusionary clipping regions.
---
--- This module works by designating a canvas and then assigning a series of graphical primitives to the canvas.  Included in this assignment list are rules about how the individual elements interact with each other within the canvas (compositing and clipping rules), and direct modification of the canvas itself (move, resize, etc.) causes all of the assigned elements to be adjusted as a group.
---
--- The canvas elements are defined in an array, and each entry of the array is a table of key-value pairs describing the element at that position.  Elements are rendered in the order in which they are assigned to the array (i.e. element 1 is drawn before element 2, etc.).
---
--- Attributes for canvas elements are defined in [hs.canvas.attributes](#attributes). All canvas elements require the `type` field; all other attributes have default values.  Fields required to properly define the element (for example, `frame` for the `rectangle` element type) will be copied into the element definition with their default values if they are not specified at the time of creation. Optional attributes will only be assigned in the element definition if they are specified.  When the module requires the value for an element's attribute it first checks the element definition itself, then the defaults are looked for in the canvas defaults, and then finally in the module's built in defaults (specified in the descriptions below).
---
--- Some examples of how to use this module can be found at https://github.com/asmagill/hammerspoon/wiki/hs.canvas.examples
---
--- If you wish to test out the `hs.drawing` wrapper which may eventually replace the original `hs.drawing` module entirely, check out [hs.canvas.drawingWrapper](#drawingWrapper).

--- Field
--- Canvas Element Attributes
---
--- * `type` - specifies the type of canvas element the table represents. This attribute has no default and must be specified for each element in the canvas array. Valid type strings are:
---   * `arc`           - an arc inscribed on a circle, defined by `radius`, `center`, `startAngle`, and `endAngle`.
---   * `canvas`        - an independent canvas object, displayed as an element within the specified frame. Defined by `canvas` and `frame`.
---   * `circle`        - a circle, defined by `radius` and `center`.
---   * `ellipticalArc` - an arc inscribed on an oval, defined by `frame`, `startAngle`, and `endAngle`.
---   * `image`         - an image as defined by one of the `hs.image` constructors.
---   * `oval`          - an oval, defined by `frame`
---   * `points`        - a list of points defined in `coordinates`.
---   * `rectangle`     - a rectangle, optionally with rounded corners, defined by `frame`.
---   * `resetClip`     - a special type -- indicates that the current clipping shape should be reset to the canvas default (the full canvas area).  See `Clipping Example`.  All other attributes, except `action` are ignored.
---   * `segments`      - a list of line segments or bezier curves with control points, defined in `coordinates`.
---   * `text`          - a string or `hs.styledtext` object, defined by `text` and `frame`.
---
--- * The following is a list of all valid attributes.  Not all attributes apply to every type, but you can set them for any type.
---   * `action`              - Default `strokeAndFill`. A string specifying the action to take for the element in the array.  The following actions are recognized:
---     * `clip`          - append the shape to the current clipping region for the canvas. Ignored for `canvas`, `image`, and `text` types.
---     * `build`         - do not render the element -- its shape is preserved and the next element in the canvas array is appended to it.  This can be used to create complex shapes or clipping regions. The stroke and fill settings for a complex object created in this manner will be those of the final object of the group. Ignored for `canvas`, `image`, and `text` types.
---     * `fill`          - fill the canvas element, if it is a shape, or display it normally if it is a `canvas`, `image` or `text`.  Ignored for `resetClip`.
---     * `skip`          - ignore this element or its effects.  Can be used to temporarily "remove" an object from the canvas.
---     * `stroke`        - stroke (outline) the canvas element, if it is a shape, or display it normally if it is a `canvas`, `image` or `text`.  Ignored for `resetClip`.
---     * `strokeAndFill` - stroke and fill the canvas element, if it is a shape, or display it normally if it is a `canvas`, `image` or `text`.  Ignored for `resetClip`.
---   * `absolutePosition`    - Default `true`. If false, numeric location and size attributes (`frame`, `center`, `radius`, and `coordinates`) will be automatically adjusted when the canvas is resized with [hs.canvas:size](#size) or [hs.canvas:frame](#frame) so that the element remains in the same relative position in the canvas.
---   * `absoluteSize`        - Default `true`. If false, numeric location and size attributes (`frame`, `center`, `radius`, and `coordinates`) will be automatically adjusted when the canvas is resized with [hs.canvas:size](#size) or [hs.canvas:frame](#frame) so that the element maintains the same relative size in the canvas.
---   * `antialias`           - Default `true`.  Indicates whether or not antialiasing should be enabled for the element.
---   * `arcRadii`            - Default `true`. Used by the `arc` and `ellipticalArc` types to specify whether or not line segments from the element's center to the start and end angles should be included in the element's visible portion.  This affects whether the object's stroke is a pie-shape or an arc with a chord from the start angle to the end angle.
---   * `arcClockwise`        - Default `true`.  Used by the `arc` and `ellipticalArc` types to specify whether the arc should be drawn from the start angle to the end angle in a clockwise (true) direction or in a counter-clockwise (false) direction.
---   * `canvas`                - Defaults to nil. A separate canvas object which is to be displayed as an element in this canvas.  The object must not currently belong to a visible window.  Assign nil to this property to release a previously assigned object for use elsewhere as an element or on its own.
---   * `canvasAlpha`           - Default `1.0`.  Specifies the alpha value to apply to the independant canvas element.
---   * `compositeRule`       - A string, default "sourceOver", specifying how this element should be combined with earlier elements of the canvas.  See [hs.canvas.compositeTypes](#compositeTypes) for a list of valid strings and their descriptions.
---   * `center`              - Default `{ x = "50%", y = "50%" }`.  Used by the `circle` and `arc` types to specify the center of the canvas element.  The `x` and `y` fields can be specified as numbers or as a string. When specified as a string, the value is treated as a percentage of the canvas size.  See the section on [percentages](#percentages) for more information.
---   * `clipToPath`          - Default `false`.   Specifies whether the clipping regions should be temporarily limited to the element's shape while rendering this element or not.  This can be used to produce crisper edges, as seen with `hs.drawing` but reduces stroke width granularity for widths less than 1.0 and causes occasional "missing" lines with the `segments` element type. Ignored for the `canvas`, `image`, `point`, and `text` types.
---   * `closed`              - Default `false`.  Used by the `segments` type to specify whether or not the shape defined by the lines and curves defined should be closed (true) or open (false).  When an object is closed, an implicit line is stroked from the final point back to the initial point of the coordinates listed.
---   * `coordinates`         - An array containing coordinates used by the `segments` and `points` types to define the lines and curves or points that make up the canvas element.  The following keys are recognized and may be specified as numbers or strings (see the section on [percentages](#percentages)).
---     * `x`   - required for `segments` and `points`, specifying the x coordinate of a point.
---     * `y`   - required for `segments` and `points`, specifying the y coordinate of a point.
---     * `c1x` - optional for `segments, specifying the x coordinate of the first control point used to draw a bezier curve between this point and the previous point.  Ignored for `points` and if present in the first coordinate in the `coordinates` array.
---     * `c1y` - optional for `segments, specifying the y coordinate of the first control point used to draw a bezier curve between this point and the previous point.  Ignored for `points` and if present in the first coordinate in the `coordinates` array.
---     * `c2x` - optional for `segments, specifying the x coordinate of the second control point used to draw a bezier curve between this point and the previous point.  Ignored for `points` and if present in the first coordinate in the `coordinates` array.
---     * `c2y` - optional for `segments, specifying the y coordinate of the second control point used to draw a bezier curve between this point and the previous point.  Ignored for `points` and if present in the first coordinate in the `coordinates` array.
---   * `endAngle`            - Default `360.0`. Used by the `arc` and `ellipticalArc` to specify the ending angle position for the inscribed arc.
---   * `fillColor`           - Default `{ red = 1.0 }`.  Specifies the color used to fill the canvas element when the `action` is set to `fill` or `strokeAndFill` and `fillGradient` is equal to `none`.  Ignored for the `canvas`, `image`, `points`, and `text` types.
---   * `fillGradient`        - Default "none".  A string specifying whether a fill gradient should be used instead of the fill color when the action is `fill` or `strokeAndFill`.  May be "none", "linear", or "radial".
---   * `fillGradientAngle`   - Default 0.0.  Specifies the direction of a linear gradient when `fillGradient` is linear.
---   * `fillGradientCenter`  - Default `{ x = 0.0, y = 0.0 }`. Specifies the relative center point within the elements bounds of a radial gradient when `fillGradient` is `radial`.  The `x` and `y` fields must both be between -1.0 and 1.0 inclusive.
---   * `fillGradientColors`  - Default `{ { white = 0.0 }, { white = 1.0 } }`.  Specifies the colors to use for the gradient when `fillGradient` is not `none`.  You must specify at least two colors, each of which must be convertible into the RGB color space (i.e. they cannot be an image being used as a color pattern).  The gradient will blend from the first to the next, and so on until the last color.  If more than two colors are specified, the "color stops" will be placed at evenly spaced intervals within the element.
---   * `flatness`            - Default `0.6`.  A number which specifies the accuracy (or smoothness) with which curves are rendered. It is also the maximum error tolerance (measured in pixels) for rendering curves, where smaller numbers give smoother curves at the expense of more computation.
---   * `flattenPath`         - Default `false`. Specifies whether curved line segments should be converted into straight line approximations. The granularity of the approximations is controlled by the path's current flatness value.
---   * `frame`               - Default `{ x = "0%", y = "0%", h = "100%", w = "100%" }`.  Used by the `rectangle`, `oval`, `ellipticalArc`, `text`, `canvas` and `image` types to specify the element's position and size.  When the key value for `x`, `y`, `h`, or `w` are specified as a string, the value is treated as a percentage of the canvas size.  See the section on [percentages](#percentages) for more information.
---   * `id`                  - An optional string or number which is included in mouse callbacks to identify the element which was the target of the mouse event.  If this is not specified for an element, it's index position is used instead.
---   * `image`               - Defaults to a blank image.  Used by the `image` type to specify an `hs.image` object to display as an image.
---   * `imageAlpha`          - Defaults to `1.0`.  A number between 0.0 and 1.0 specifying the alpha value to be applied to the image specified by `image`.  Note that if an image is a template image, then this attribute will internally default to `0.5` unless explicitly set for the element.
---   * `imageAlignment`      - Default "center". A string specifying the alignment of the image within the canvas element's frame.  Valid values for this attribute are "center", "bottom", "topLeft", "bottomLeft", "bottomRight", "left", "right", "top", and "topRight".
---   * `imageAnimationFrame` - Default `0`. An integer specifying the image frame to display when the image is from an animated GIF.  This attribute is ignored for other image types.  May be specified as a negative integer indicating that the image frame should be calculated from the last frame and calculated backwards (i.e. specifying `-1` selects the last frame for the GIF.)
---   * `imageAnimates`       - Default `false`. A boolean specifying whether or not an animated GIF should be animated or if only a single frame should be shown.  Ignored for other image types.
---   * `imageScaling`        - Default "scalePropertionally".  A string specifying how the image should be scaled within the canvas element's frame.  Valid values for this attribute are:
---     * `scaleToFit`          - shrink the image, preserving the aspect ratio, to fit the drawing frame only if the image is larger than the drawing frame.
---     * `shrinkToFit`         - shrink or expand the image to fully fill the drawing frame.  This does not preserve the aspect ratio.
---     * `none`                - perform no scaling or resizing of the image.
---     * `scaleProportionally` - shrink or expand the image to fully fill the drawing frame, preserving the aspect ration.
---   * `miterLimit`          - Default `10.0`. The limit at which miter joins are converted to bevel join when `strokeJoinStyle` is `miter`.  The miter limit helps you avoid spikes at the junction of two line segments.  When the ratio of the miter length—the diagonal length of the miter join—to the line thickness exceeds the miter limit, the joint is converted to a bevel join. Ignored for the `canvas`, `text`, and `image` types.
---   * `padding`             - Default `0.0`. When an element specifies position information by percentage (i.e. as a string), the actual frame used for calculating position values is inset from the canvas frame on all sides by this amount. If you are using shadows with your elements, the shadow position is not included in the element's size and position specification; this attribute can be used to provide extra space for the shadow to be fully rendered within the canvas.
---   * `radius`              - Default "50%". Used by the `arc` and `circle` types to specify the radius of the circle for the element. May be specified as a string or a number.  When specified as a string, the value is treated as a percentage of the canvas size.  See the section on [percentages](#percentages) for more information.
---   * `reversePath`         - Default `false`.  Specifies drawing direction for the canvas element.  By default, canvas elements are drawn from the point nearest the origin (top left corner) in a clockwise direction.  Setting this to true causes the element to be drawn in a counter-clockwise direction. This will mostly affect fill and stroke dash patterns, but can also be used with clipping regions to create cut-outs.  Ignored for `canvas`, `image`, and `text` types.
---   * `roundedRectRadii`    - Default `{ xRadis = 0.0, yRadius = 0.0 }`.
---   * `shadow`              - Default `{ blurRadius = 5.0, color = { alpha = 1/3 }, offset = { h = -5.0, w = 5.0 } }`.  Specifies the shadow blurring, color, and offset to be added to an element which has `withShadow` set to true.
---   * `startAngle`          - Default `0.0`. Used by the `arc` and `ellipticalArc` to specify the starting angle position for the inscribed arc.
---   * `strokeCapStyle`      - Default "butt". A string which specifies the shape of the endpoints of an open path when stroked.  Primarily noticeable for lines rendered with the `segments` type.  Valid values for this attribute are "butt", "round", and "square".
---   * `strokeColor`         - Default `{ white = 0 }`.  Specifies the stroke (outline) color for a canvas element when the action is set to `stroke` or `strokeAndFill`.  Ignored for the `canvas`, `text`, and `image` types.
---   * `strokeDashPattern`   - Default `{}`.  Specifies an array of numbers specifying a dash pattern for stroked lines when an element's `action` attribute is set to `stroke` or `strokeAndFill`.  The numbers in the array alternate with the first element specifying a dash length in points, the second specifying a gap length in points, the third a dash length, etc.  The array repeats to fully stroke the element.  Ignored for the `canvas`, `image`, and `text` types.
---   * `strokeDashPhase`     - Default `0.0`.  Specifies an offset, in points, where the dash pattern specified by `strokeDashPattern` should start. Ignored for the `canvas`, `image`, and `text` types.
---   * `strokeJoinStyle`     - Default "miter".  A string which specifies the shape of the joints between connected segments of a stroked path.  Valid values for this attribute are "miter", "round", and "bevel".  Ignored for element types of `canvas`, `image`, and `text`.
---   * `strokeWidth`         - Default `1.0`.  Specifies the width of stroked lines when an element's action is set to `stroke` or `strokeAndFill`.  Ignored for the `canvas`, `image`, and `text` element types.
---   * `text`                - Default `""`.  Specifies the text to display for a `text` element.  This may be specified as a string, or as an `hs.styledtext` object.
---   * `textAlignment`       - Default `natural`. A string specifying the alignment of the text within a canvas element of type `text`.  This field is ignored if the text is specified as an `hs.styledtext` object.  Valid values for this attributes are:
---     * `left`      - the text is visually left aligned.
---     * `right`     - the text is visually right aligned.
---     * `center`    - the text is visually center aligned.
---     * `justified` - the text is justified
---     * `natural`   - the natural alignment of the text’s script
---   * `textColor`           - Default `{ white = 1.0 }`.  Specifies the color to use when displaying the `text` element type, if the text is specified as a string.  This field is ignored if the text is specified as an `hs.styledtext` object.
---   * `textFont`            - Defaults to the default system font.  A string specifying the name of thefont to use when displaying the `text` element type, if the text is specified as a string.  This field is ignored if the text is specified as an `hs.styledtext` object.
---   * `textLineBreak`       - Default `wordWrap`. A string specifying how to wrap text which exceeds the canvas element's frame for an element of type `text`.  This field is ignored if the text is specified as an `hs.styledtext` object.  Valid values for this attribute are:
---     * `wordWrap`       - wrap at word boundaries, unless the word itself doesn’t fit on a single line
---     * `charWrap`       - wrap before the first character that doesn’t fit
---     * `clip`           - do not draw past the edge of the drawing object frame
---     * `truncateHead`   - the line is displayed so that the end fits in the frame and the missing text at the beginning of the line is indicated by an ellipsis
---     * `truncateTail`   - the line is displayed so that the beginning fits in the frame and the missing text at the end of the line is indicated by an ellipsis
---     * `truncateMiddle` - the line is displayed so that the beginning and end fit in the frame and the missing text in the middle is indicated by an ellipsis
---   * `textSize`            - Default `27.0`.  Specifies the font size to use when displaying the `text` element type, if the text is specified as a string.  This field is ignored if the text is specified as an `hs.styledtext` object.
---   * `trackMouseByBounds`  - Default `false`. If true, mouse events are based on the element's bounds (smallest rectangle which completely contains the element); otherwise, mouse events are based on the visible portion of the canvas element.
---   * `trackMouseEnterExit` - Default `false`.  Generates a callback when the mouse enters or exits the canvas element.  For `canvas` and `text` types, the `frame` of the element defines the boundaries of the tracking area.
---   * `trackMouseDown`      - Default `false`.  Generates a callback when mouse button is clicked down while the cursor is within the canvas element.  For `canvas` and `text` types, the `frame` of the element defines the boundaries of the tracking area.
---   * `trackMouseUp`        - Default `false`.  Generates a callback when mouse button is released while the cursor is within the canvas element.  For `canvas` and `text` types, the `frame` of the element defines the boundaries of the tracking area.
---   * `trackMouseMove`      - Default `false`.  Generates a callback when the mouse cursor moves within the canvas element.  For `canvas` and `text` types, the `frame` of the element defines the boundaries of the tracking area.
---   * `transformation`      - Default `{ m11 = 1.0, m12 = 0.0, m21 = 0.0, m22 = 1.0, tX = 0.0, tY = 0.0 }`. Specifies a matrix transformation to apply to the element before displaying it.  Transformations may include rotation, translation, scaling, skewing, etc.
---   * `windingRule`         - Default "nonZero".  A string specifying the winding rule in effect for the canvas element. May be "nonZero" or "evenOdd".  The winding rule determines which portions of an element to fill. This setting will only have a visible effect on compound elements (built with the `build` action) or elements of type `segments` when the object is made from lines which cross.
---   * `withShadow`          - Default `false`. Specifies whether a shadow effect should be applied to the canvas element.  Ignored for the `text` type.

--- hs.canvas:frame([rect]) -> canvasObject | currentValue
--- Method
--- Get or set the frame of the canvasObject.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * rect - An optional rect-table containing the co-ordinates and size the canvas object should be moved and set to
---
--- Returns:
---  * If an argument is provided, the canvas object; otherwise the current value.
---
--- Notes:
---  * a rect-table is a table with key-value pairs specifying the new top-left coordinate on the screen of the canvas (keys `x`  and `y`) and the new size (keys `h` and `w`).  The table may be crafted by any method which includes these keys, including the use of an `hs.geometry` object.
---
---  * elements in the canvas that have the `absolutePosition` attribute set to false will be moved so that their relative position within the canvas remains the same with respect to the new size.
---  * elements in the canvas that have the `absoluteSize` attribute set to false will be resized so that their relative size with respect to the canvas remains the same with respect to the new size.

---    * if true, place the canvas on top of all windows (including the dock and menubar and fullscreen windows).
---    * if false, place the canvas above normal windows, but below the dock, menubar and fullscreen windows.
---
--- Returns:

---
--- Returns:

---
--- Notes:

--- hs.canvas:appendElements(element, ...) -> canvasObject
--- Method
--- Appends the elements specified to the canvas.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `element` - a table containing key-value pairs that define the element to be appended to the canvas.  You can specify one or more elements and they will be appended in the order they are listed.
---
--- Returns:
---  * the canvas object
---
--- Notes:
---  * You can also specify multiple elements in a table as an array, where each index in the table contains an element table, and use the array as a single argument to this method if this style works better in your code.

--- hs.canvas:replaceElements(element, ...) -> canvasObject
--- Method
--- Replaces all of the elements in the canvas with the elements specified.  Shortens or lengthens the canvas element count if necessary to accomodate the new canvas elements.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `element` - a table containing key-value pairs that define the element to be assigned to the canvas.  You can specify one or more elements and they will be appended in the order they are listed.
---
--- Returns:
---  * the canvas object
---
--- Notes:

--- hs.canvas:rotateElement(index, angle, [point], [append]) -> canvasObject
--- Method
--- Rotates an element about the point specified, or the elements center if no point is specified.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * `index`  - the index of the element to rotate
---  * `angle`  - the angle to rotate the object in a clockwise direction
---  * `point`  - an optional point table, defaulting to the elements center, specifying the point around which the object should be rotated
---  * `append` - an optional boolean, default false, specifying whether or not the rotation transformation matrix should be appended to the existing transformation assigned to the element (true) or replace it (false).
---
--- Returns:
---  * the canvas object
---
--- Notes:
---  * a point-table is a table with key-value pairs specifying a coordinate in the canvas (keys `x`  and `y`). The table may be crafted by any method which includes these keys, including the use of an `hs.geometry` object.
---  * The center of the object is determined by getting the element's bounds with [hs.canvas:elementBounds](#elementBounds).
---  * If the third argument is a boolean value, the `point` argument is assumed to be the element's center and the boolean value is used as the `append` argument.
---
---  * This method uses [hs.canvas.matrix](MATRIX.md) to generate the rotation transformation and provides a wrapper for `hs.canvas.matrix.translate(x, y):rotate(angle):translate(-x, -y)` which is then assigned or appended to the element's existing `transformation` attribute.

--- hs.canvas:copy() -> canvasObject
--- Method
--- Creates a copy of the canvas.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * a copy of the canvas
---
--- Notes:
---  * The copy of the canvas will be identical in all respectes except:
---    * The new canvas will not have a callback function assigned, even if the original canvas does.
---    * The new canvas will not initially be visible, even if the original is.
---  * The new canvas is an independant entity -- any subsequent changes to either canvas will not be reflected in the other canvas.
---
---  * This method allows you to display a canvas in multiple places or use it as a canvas element multiple times.

--- hs.canvas.object[index]
--- Field
--- An array-like method for accessing the attributes for the canvas element at the specified index
---
--- Metamethods are assigned to the canvas object so that you can refer to individual elements of the canvas as if the canvas object was an array.  Each element is represented by a table of key-value pairs, where each key represents an attribute for that element.  Valid index numbers range from 1 to [hs.canvas:elementCount()](#elementCount) when getting an element or getting or setting one of its attributes, and from 1 to [hs.canvas:elementCount()](#elementCount) + 1 when assign an element table to an index in the canvas.  For example:
---
--- ~~~lua
--- c = require("hs.canvas")
--- a = c.new{ x = 100, y = 100, h = 100, w = 100 }:show()
--- a:insertElement({ type = "rectangle", id = "part1", fillColor = { blue = 1 } })
--- a:insertElement({ type = "circle", id = "part2", fillColor = { green = 1 } })
--- ~~~
--- can also be expressed as:
--- ~~~lua
--- c = require("hs.canvas")
--- a = c.new{ x = 100, y = 100, h = 100, w = 100 }:show()
--- a[1] = { type = "rectangle", id = "part1", fillColor = { blue = 1 } }
--- a[2] = { type = "circle", id = "part2", fillColor = { green = 1 } }
--- ~~~
---
--- You can change a canvas element's attributes using this same style: `a[2].fillColor.alpha = .5` will adjust the alpha value for element 2 of the canvas without adjusting any of the other color fields.  To replace the color entirely, assign it like this: `a[2].fillColor = { white = .5, alpha = .25 }`
---
--- The canvas defaults can also be accessed with the `_default` field like this: `a._default.strokeWidth = 5`.
---
--- Attributes which have a string specified as their `id` attribute can also be accessed as if the `id` where a `key` in the table-like canvas: e.g. `a.part2.action = "skip"`
---
--- It is important to note that these methods are a convenience and that the canvas object is not a true table.  The tables are generated dynamically as needed; as such `hs.inspect` cannot properly display them; however, you can just type in the element or element attribute you wish to see expanded in the Hammerspoon console (or in a `print` command) to see the assigned attributes, e.g. `a[1]` or `a[2].fillColor`, and an inspect-like output will be provided.
---
--- Attributes which allow using a string to specify a percentage (see [percentages](#percentages)) can also be retrieved as their actual number for the canvas's current size by appending `_raw` to the attribute name, e.g. `a[2].frame_raw`.
---
--- Because the canvas object is actually a Lua userdata, and not a real table, you cannot use the `table.insert` and `table.remove` functions on it.  For inserting or removing an element in any position except at the end of the canvas, you must still use [hs.canvas:insertElement](#insertElement) and [hs.canvas:removeElement](#removeElement).
---
--- You can, however, remove the last element with `a[#a] = nil`.
---
--- To print out all of the elements in the canvas with: `for i, v in ipairs(a) do print(v) end`.  The `pairs` iterator will also work, and will work on element sub-tables (transformations, fillColor and strokeColor, etc.), but this iterator does not guarantee order.

---  * the current, possibly newly changed, state.
---
--- Notes:
---  * This module was designed to address some of the limitations found with the `hs.drawing` module.  It is expected that at some point this module may completely replace the existing `hs.drawing` as it provides more flexibility and will be easier to extend with future additions. This function allows you to choose whether or not you wish to migrate fully to this new drawing model now to facilitate the testing of the wrapper or not.
---  * This wrapper was designed to fully mimic the current `hs.drawing` functions and methods -- you should not need to change your existing code in any way once this wrapper is enabled.  If you find that you do need to make adjustments or that something in the wrapper does not work as expected, please log an issue at https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/issues.
---
---  * When you change the wrapper state with this function, you must reload or restart your Hammerspoon application for the changes to go into effect.  It is expected that you will run this command from the Hammerspoon console like `hs.canvas.drawingWrapper(true)` and then reload your Hammerspoon configuration.  You will not need to do this again unless you wish to change back to the original `hs.drawing` module.
module.drawingWrapper = function(...)
    local args = table.pack(...)
    local settings = require("hs.settings")
    local oldState = settings.get("useCanvasWrappedDrawing") and true or false -- force nil to be false
    if args.n > 0 then
        local state = args[1] and true or false
        settings.set("useCanvasWrappedDrawing", state)
        if state ~= oldState then
            print("You will need to reload or restart Hammerspoon for the changes to take effect")
        end
    end
    return settings.get("useCanvasWrappedDrawing") and true or false
end

--- hs.canvas.percentages
--- Field
--- Canvas attributes which specify the location and size of canvas elements can be specified with an absolute position or as a percentage of the canvas size.
---
--- Percentages may be assigned to the following attributes:
---  * `frame`       - the frame used by the `rectangle`, `oval`, `ellipticalArc`, `text`, and `image` types.  The `x` and `w` fields will be a percentage of the canvas's width, and the `y` and `h` fields will be a percentage of the canvas's height.
---  * `center`      - the center point for the `circle` and `arc` types.  The `x` field will be a percentage of the canvas's width and the `y` field will be a percentage of the canvas's height.
---  * `radius`      - the radius for the `circle` and `arc` types.  The radius will be a percentage of the canvas's width.
---  * `coordinates` - the point coordinates used by the `segments` and `points` types.  X coordinates (fields `x`, `c1x`, and `c2x`) will be a percentage of the canvas's width, and Y coordinates (fields `y`, `c1y`, and `c2y`) will be a percentage of the canvas's height.
---
--- Percentages are assigned to these fields as a string.  If the number in the string ends with a percent sign (%), then the percentage is the whole number which precedes the percent sign.  If no percent sign is present, the percentage is expected in decimal format (e.g. "1.0" is the same as "100%").
---
--- Because a shadow applied to a canvas element is not considered as part of the element's bounds, you can also set the `padding` attribute to a positive number of points to inset the calculated values by from each edge of the canvas's frame so that the shadow will be fully visible within the canvas, even when an element is set to a width and height of "100%".
