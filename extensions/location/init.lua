--- === hs.location ===
---
--- Determine the machine's location and useful information about that location
---
--- This module provides functions for getting current location information and tracking location changes. It expands on the earlier version of the module by adding the ability to create independant locationObjects which can enable/disable location tracking independant of other uses of Location Services by Hammerspoon, adds region monitoring for exit and entry, and adds the retrieval of geocoding information through the `hs.location.geocoder` submodule.
---
--- This module is backwards compatible with its predecessor with the following changes:
---  * [hs.location.get](#get) - no longer requires that you invoke [hs.location.start](#start) before using this function. The information returned will be the last cached value, which is updated internally whenever additional WiFi networks are detected or lost (not necessarily joined). When update tracking is enabled with the [hs.location.start](#start) function, calculations based upon the RSSI of all currently seen networks are preformed more often to provide a more precise fix, but it's still based on the WiFi networks near you. In many cases, the value retrieved when the WiFi state is changed should be sufficiently accurate.
---  * [hs.location.servicesEnabled](#servicesEnabled) - replaces `hs.location.services_enabled`. While the earlier function is included for backwards compatibility, it will display a deprecation warning to the console the first time it is invoked and may go away completely in the future.
---
--- The following labels are used to describe tables which are used by functions and methods as parameters or return values in this module and in `hs.location.geocoder`. These tables are described as follows:
---
---  * `locationTable` - a table specifying location coordinates containing one or more of the following key-value pairs:
---    * `latitude`           - a number specifying the latitude in degrees. Positive values indicate latitudes north of the equator. Negative values indicate latitudes south of the equator. When not specified in a table being used as an argument, this defaults to 0.0.
---    * `longitude`          - a number specifying the longitude in degrees. Measurements are relative to the zero meridian, with positive values extending east of the meridian and negative values extending west of the meridian. When not specified in a table being used as an argument, this defaults to 0.0.
---    * `altitude`           - a number indicating altitude above (positive) or below (negative) sea-level. When not specified in a table being used as an argument, this defaults to 0.0.
---    * `horizontalAccuracy` - a number specifying the radius of uncertainty for the location, measured in meters. If negative, the `latitude` and `longitude` keys are invalid and should not be trusted. When not specified in a table being used as an argument, this defaults to 0.0.
---    * `verticalAccuracy`   - a number specifying the accuracy of the altitude value in meters. If negative, the `altitude` key is invalid and should not be trusted. When not specified in a table being used as an argument, this defaults to -1.0.
---    * `course`             - a number specifying the direction in which the device is traveling. If this value is negative, then the value is invalid and should not be trusted. On current Macintosh models, this will almost always be a negative number. When not specified in a table being used as an argument, this defaults to -1.0.
---    * `speed`              - a number specifying the instantaneous speed of the device in meters per second. If this value is negative, then the value is invalid and should not be trusted. On current Macintosh models, this will almost always be a negative number. When not specified in a table being used as an argument, this defaults to -1.0.
---    * `timestamp`          - a number specifying the time at which this location was determined. This number is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 at midnight, GMT, and is a floating point number, so you should use `math.floor` on this number before using it as an argument to Lua's `os.date` function. When not specified in a table being used as an argument, this defaults to the current time.
---
---  * `regionTable` - a table specifying a circular region containing one or more of the following key-value pairs:
---    * `identifier`    - a string for use in identifying the region. When not specified in a table being used as an argument, a new value is generated with `hs.host.uuid`.
---    * `latitude`      - a number specifying the latitude in degrees. Positive values indicate latitudes north of the equator. Negative values indicate latitudes south of the equator. When not specified in a table being used as an argument, this defaults to 0.0.
---    * `longitude`     - a number specifying the latitude in degrees. Positive values indicate latitudes north of the equator. Negative values indicate latitudes south of the equator. When not specified in a table being used as an argument, this defaults to 0.0.
---    * `radius`        - a number specifying the radius (measured in meters) that defines the regionâ€™s outer boundary. When not specified in a table being used as an argument, this defaults to 0.0.
---    * `notifyOnEntry` - a boolean specifying whether or not a callback with the "didEnterRegion" message should be generated when the machine enters the region. When not specified in a table being used as an argument, this defaults to true.
---    * `notifyOnExit`  - a boolean specifying whether or not a callback with the "didExitRegion" message should be generated when the machine exits the region. When not specified in a table being used as an argument, this defaults to true.

--- hs.location:callback(fn | nil) -> locationObject
--- Method
--- Sets or removes the callback function for this locationObject
---
--- Parameters:
---  * a function, or nil to remove the current function, which will be invoked as a callback for messages generated by this locationObject.  The callback function should expect 3 or 4 arguments as follows:
---    * the locationObject itself
---    * a string specifying the message generated by the locationObject:
---      * "didChangeAuthorizationStatus" - the user has changed the authorization status for Hammerspoon's use of Location Services.  The third argument will be a string as described in the [hs.location.authorizationStatus](#authorizationStatus) function.
---      * "didUpdateLocations"           - the current location has changed or been refined.  This message will only occur if location tracking has been enabled with [hs.location:startTracking](#startTracking). The third argument will be a table containing one or more locationTables as array elements.  The most recent location update is contained in the last element of the array.
---      * "didFailWithError"             - there was an error retrieving location information. The third argument will be a string describing the error that occurred.
---      * "didStartMonitoringForRegion"  - a new region has successfully been added to the regions being monitored.  The third argument will be the regionTable for the region which was just added.
---      * "monitoringDidFailForRegion"   - an error occurred while trying to add a new region to the list of monitored regions. The third argument will be the regionTable for the region that could not be added, and the fourth argument will be a string containing an error message describing why monitoring for the region failed.
---      * "didEnterRegion"               - the current location has entered a region with the `notifyOnEntry` field set to true specified with the [hs.location:addMonitoredRegion](#addMonitoredRegion) method. The third argument will be the regionTable for the region entered.
---      * "didExitRegion"                - the current location has exited a region with the `notifyOnExit` field set to true specified with the [hs.location:addMonitoredRegion](#addMonitoredRegion) method. The third argument will be the regionTable for the region exited.
---
--- Returns:
---  * the locationObject

--- hs.location:location() -> locationTable | nil
--- Method
--- Returns the current location
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * If successful, a locationTable as described in the module header, otherwise nil.
---
--- Notes:
---  * This function activates Location Services for Hammerspoon, so the first time you call this, you may be prompted to authorise Hammerspoon to use Location Services.
---  * If access to Location Services is enabled for Hammerspoon, this function will return the most recent cached data for the computer's location.
---    * Internally, the Location Services cache is updated whenever additional WiFi networks are detected or lost (not necessarily joined). When update tracking is enabled with the [hs.location.start](#start) function, calculations based upon the RSSI of all currently seen networks are preformed more often to provide a more precise fix, but it's still based on the WiFi networks near you.
