local hotkey = require "hs.hotkey.internal"

--- hs.hotkey.new(mods, key, pressedfn[, releasedfn, repeatfn]) -> hotkeyObject or nil
--- Constructor
--- Creates a new hotkey
---
--- Parameters:
---  * mods - A table containing the keyboard modifiers required, which should be zero or more of the following strings:
---   * cmd
---   * alt
---   * shift
---   * ctrl
---  * key - A string containing the name of a keyboard key (as found in [hs.keycodes.map](hs.keycodes.html#map) ), or if the string begins with a `#` symbol, the remainder of the string will be treated as a raw keycode number
---  * pressedfn - A function that will be called when the hotkey has been pressed
---  * releasedfn - An optional function that will be called when the hotkey has been released
---  * repeatfn - An optional function that will be called when a pressed hotkey is repeating
---
--- Returns:
---  * An `hs.hotkey` object, or nil if an error occurred

--- hs.hotkey.bind(mods, key, pressedfn, releasedfn, repeatfn) -> hotkeyObject or nil
--- Constructor
--- Creates a hotkey and enables it immediately
---
--- Parameters:
---  * mods - A table containing the keyboard modifiers required, which should be zero or more of the following strings:
---   * cmd
---   * alt
---   * shift
---   * ctrl
---  * key - A string containing the name of a keyboard key (as found in [hs.keycodes.map](hs.keycodes.html#map) ), or if the string begins with a `#` symbol, the remainder of the string will be treated as a raw keycode number
---  * pressedfn - A function that will be called when the hotkey has been pressed
---  * releasedfn - An optional function that will be called when the hotkey has been released
---  * repeatfn - An optional function that will be called when a pressed hotkey is repeating
---
--- Returns:
---  * An `hs.hotkey` object or nil if an error occurred
---
--- Notes:
---  * This function is a simple wrapper that performs: `hs.hotkey.new(mods, key, pressedfn, releasedfn, repeatfn):enable()`

--- === hs.hotkey.modal ===
---
--- Create/manage modal keyboard shortcut environments
---
--- This would be a simple example usage:
---
---     k = hs.hotkey.modal.new({"cmd", "shift"}, "d")
---
---     function k:entered() hs.alert.show('Entered mode') end
---     function k:exited()  hs.alert.show('Exited mode')  end
---
---     k:bind({}, 'escape', function() k:exit() end)
---     k:bind({}, 'J', function() hs.alert.show("Pressed J") end)

hotkey.modal = {}
hotkey.modal.__index = hotkey.modal

--- hs.hotkey.modal:entered()
--- Method
--- Optional callback for when a modal is entered; default implementation does nothing.
function hotkey.modal:entered()
end

--- hs.hotkey.modal:exited()
--- Method
--- Optional callback for when a modal is exited; default implementation does nothing.
function hotkey.modal:exited()
end

--- hs.hotkey.modal:bind(mods, key, pressedfn, releasedfn, repeatfn)
--- Method
---
--- Parameters:
---  * mods - A table containing the keyboard modifiers required, which should be zero or more of the following strings:
---   * cmd
---   * alt
---   * shift
---   * ctrl
---  * key - A string containing the name of a keyboard key (as found in [hs.keycodes.map](hs.keycodes.html#map) ), or if the string begins with a `#` symbol, the remainder of the string will be treated as a raw keycode number
---  * pressedfn - A function that will be called when the hotkey has been pressed
---  * releasedfn - An optional function that will be called when the hotkey has been released
---  * repeatfn - An optional function that will be called when a pressed hotkey is repeating
---
--- Returns:
---  * An `hs.hotkey.modal` object or nil if an error occurred
---
function hotkey.modal:bind(mods, key, pressedfn, releasedfn, repeatfn)
  local k = hotkey.new(mods, key, pressedfn, releasedfn, repeatfn)
  table.insert(self.keys, k)
  return self
end

--- hs.hotkey.modal:enter()
--- Method
--- Enables all hotkeys created via `modal:bind` and disables the modal itself.
--- Called automatically when the modal's hotkey is pressed.
function hotkey.modal:enter()
  if (self.k) then
    self.k:disable()
  end
  hs.fnutils.each(self.keys, hotkey.enable)
  self.entered()
  return self
end

--- hs.hotkey.modal:exit()
--- Method
--- Disables all hotkeys created via `modal:bind` and re-enables the modal itself.
function hotkey.modal:exit()
  hs.fnutils.each(self.keys, hotkey.disable)
  if (self.k) then
    self.k:enable()
  end
  self.exited()
  return self
end

--- hs.hotkey.modal.new(mods, key) -> modal
--- Constructor
--- Creates a new modal hotkey and enables it.
--- When mods and key are pressed, all keys bound via `modal:bind` will be enabled.
--- They are disabled when the "mode" is exited via `modal:exit()`
--- If mods and key are both nil, the modal state will be created with no top-level hotkey to enter the modal state. This is useful where you want a modal state to exist, but be entered programatically.
