--- === hs.blackmagic ===
---
--- Support for the Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve Speed Editor Keyboard and Editor Keyboard.
---
--- Example Usage:
--- ```lua
--- blackmagic = nil
---
--- local callback = function(obj, buttonID, pressed, mode, value)
---     if buttonID == "JOG WHEEL" then
---         print("Jog Wheel Mode " .. mode .. ", value: " .. value)
---     else
---         -- If Jog Wheel button pressed, change jog wheel mode
---         -- and activate the LED for that job wheel mode:
---         if buttonID == "SHTL" or buttonID == "JOG" or buttonID == "SCRL" then
---             local jogMode
---             if buttonID == "SHTL" then jogMode = "RELATIVE" end
---             if buttonID == "JOG" then jogMode = "ABSOLUTE" end
---             if buttonID == "SCRL" then jogMode = "ABSOLUTE ZERO" end
---             blackmagic:jogMode(jogMode)
---
---             blackmagic:led({
---                 ["SHTL"] = buttonID == "SHTL",
---                 ["JOG"] = buttonID == "JOG",
---                 ["SCRL"] = buttonID == "SCRL"
---             })
---             return
---         end
---
---         -- If a normal button is pressed:
---         if pressed then
---             print(buttonID .. " pressed")
---             blackmagic:led({[buttonID] = true})
---         else
---             print(buttonID .. " released")
---             hs.timer.doAfter(5, function()
---                 blackmagic:led({[buttonID] = false})
---             end)
---         end
---     end
--- end
---
--- local discoveryCallback = function(connected, device)
---     if connected then
---         print(string.format("Device Connected: %s - %s", device:deviceType(), device:serialNumber()))
---         blackmagic = device
---         blackmagic:led({["SHTL"] = true}) -- Defaults to SHTL jog mode
---         blackmagic:jogMode("RELATIVE")
---         blackmagic:callback(callback)
---     else
---         print(string.format("Device Disconnected: %s - %s", device:deviceType(), device:serialNumber()))
---     end
--- end
---
--- hs.blackmagic.init(discoveryCallback)
--- ```
