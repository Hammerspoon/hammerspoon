 * the Decodable extension implementation to a class that is not public.
 *
 * @note: We canâ€™t add the extension for Decodable directly on SentryEvent, because we get an error
 * in SentryReplayEvent: 'required' initializer 'init(from:)' must be provided by subclass of
 * 'Event' Once we add the initializer with required convenience public init(from decoder: any
 * Decoder) throws { fatalError("init(from:) has not been implemented")
 * }
 * we get the error initializer 'init(from:)' is declared in extension of 'Event' and cannot be
 * overridden. Therefore, we add the Decodable implementation not on the Event, but to a subclass of
 * the event.
