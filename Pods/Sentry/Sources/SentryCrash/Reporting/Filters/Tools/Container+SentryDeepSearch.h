/** Deep key search based methods for hierarchical container structures.
 *
 * A deep key search works like a normal search, except that the "key" is
 * interpreted as a series of keys, to be recursively applied in a "drill down"
 * fashion. There are two variants of each: the "deep key" variant, where the
 * key series is passed as an array, and the "key path" variant, where the
 * key series is passed as a serialized path, similar to filesystem paths
 * (a string where entries are separated by slashes).
 *
 * For example, if objectForDeepKey were called with [@"top", @"sublevel", @"2",
 * @"item] (or objectForKeyPath were called with @"top/sublevel/2/item"), it
 * would search as follows:
 *
 *    result = [self objectForKey:@"top"];
 *    result = [result objectForKey:@"sublevel"];
 *    result = [result objectForKey:@"2"];
 *    result = [result objectForKey:@"item"];
 *
 * Note that if any potential container along the way does not respond to
 * "objectForKey:", it will check to see if the container responds to
 * "objectAtIndex:" AND the current key responds to "intValue". If both do
 * respond, it will retrieve the current result using an array lookup:
 *
 *    result = [result objectAtIndex:[currentKey intValue]];
