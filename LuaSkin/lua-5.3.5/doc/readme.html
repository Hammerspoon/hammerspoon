<H2><A NAME="about">About Lua</A></H2>
<P>
Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language
developed by a
<A HREF="http://www.lua.org/authors.html">team</A>
at
<A HREF="http://www.puc-rio.br/">PUC-Rio</A>,
the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.
Lua is
<A HREF="#license">free software</A>
used in many products and projects around the world.

<P>
Lua's
<A HREF="http://www.lua.org/">official web site</A>
provides complete information
about Lua,
including
an
<A HREF="http://www.lua.org/about.html">executive summary</A>
and
updated
<A HREF="http://www.lua.org/docs.html">documentation</A>,
especially the
<A HREF="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/">reference manual</A>,
which may differ slightly from the
<A HREF="contents.html">local copy</A>
distributed in this package.

<H2><A NAME="install">Installing Lua</A></H2>
<P>
Lua is distributed in
<A HREF="http://www.lua.org/ftp/">source</A>
form.
You need to build it before using it.
Building Lua should be straightforward
because
Lua is implemented in pure ANSI C and compiles unmodified in all known
platforms that have an ANSI C compiler.
Lua also compiles unmodified as C++.
The instructions given below for building Lua are for Unix-like platforms.
See also
<A HREF="#other">instructions for other systems</A>
and
<A HREF="#customization">customization options</A>.

<P>
If you don't have the time or the inclination to compile Lua yourself,
get a binary from
<A HREF="http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaBinaries">LuaBinaries</A>.
Try also
<A HREF="http://luadist.org/">LuaDist</A>,
a multi-platform distribution of Lua that includes batteries.

<H3>Building Lua</H3>
<P>
In most Unix-like platforms, simply do "<KBD>make</KBD>" with a suitable target.
Here are the details.

<OL>
<LI>
Open a terminal window and move to
the top-level directory, which is named <TT>lua-5.3.5</TT>.
The <TT>Makefile</TT> there controls both the build process and the installation process.
<P>
<LI>
  Do "<KBD>make</KBD>" and see if your platform is listed.
  The platforms currently supported are:
<P>
<P CLASS="display">
   aix bsd c89 freebsd generic linux macosx mingw posix solaris
</P>
<P>
  If your platform is listed, just do "<KBD>make xxx</KBD>", where xxx
  is your platform name.
<P>
  If your platform is not listed, try the closest one or posix, generic,
  c89, in this order.
<P>
<LI>
The compilation takes only a few moments
and produces three files in the <TT>src</TT> directory:
lua (the interpreter),
luac (the compiler),
and liblua.a (the library).
<P>
<LI>
  To check that Lua has been built correctly, do "<KBD>make test</KBD>"
  after building Lua. This will run the interpreter and print its version.
</OL>
<P>
If you're running Linux and get compilation errors,
make sure you have installed the <TT>readline</TT> development package
(which is probably named <TT>libreadline-dev</TT> or <TT>readline-devel</TT>).
If you get link errors after that,
then try "<KBD>make linux MYLIBS=-ltermcap</KBD>".

<H3>Installing Lua</H3>
<P>
  Once you have built Lua, you may want to install it in an official
  place in your system. In this case, do "<KBD>make install</KBD>". The official
  place and the way to install files are defined in the <TT>Makefile</TT>. You'll
  probably need the right permissions to install files.

<P>
  To build and install Lua in one step, do "<KBD>make xxx install</KBD>",
  where xxx is your platform name.

<P>
  To install Lua locally, do "<KBD>make local</KBD>".
  This will create a directory <TT>install</TT> with subdirectories
  <TT>bin</TT>, <TT>include</TT>, <TT>lib</TT>, <TT>man</TT>, <TT>share</TT>,
  and install Lua as listed below.

  To install Lua locally, but in some other directory, do
  "<KBD>make install INSTALL_TOP=xxx</KBD>", where xxx is your chosen directory.
  The installation starts in the <TT>src</TT> and <TT>doc</TT> directories,
  so take care if <TT>INSTALL_TOP</TT> is not an absolute path.

<DL CLASS="display">
<DT>
    bin:
<DD>
    lua luac
<DT>
    include:
<DD>
    lua.h luaconf.h lualib.h lauxlib.h lua.hpp
<DT>
    lib:
<DD>
    liblua.a
<DT>
    man/man1:
<DD>
    lua.1 luac.1
</DL>

<P>
  These are the only directories you need for development.
  If you only want to run Lua programs,
  you only need the files in <TT>bin</TT> and <TT>man</TT>.
  The files in <TT>include</TT> and <TT>lib</TT> are needed for
  embedding Lua in C or C++ programs.

<H3><A NAME="customization">Customization</A></H3>
<P>
  Three kinds of things can be customized by editing a file:
<UL>
    <LI> Where and how to install Lua &mdash; edit <TT>Makefile</TT>.
    <LI> How to build Lua &mdash; edit <TT>src/Makefile</TT>.
    <LI> Lua features &mdash; edit <TT>src/luaconf.h</TT>.
</UL>

<P>
  You don't actually need to edit the Makefiles because you may set the
  relevant variables in the command line when invoking make.
  Nevertheless, it's probably best to edit and save the Makefiles to
  record the changes you've made.

<P>
  On the other hand, if you need to customize some Lua features, you'll need
  to edit <TT>src/luaconf.h</TT> before building and installing Lua.
  The edited file will be the one installed, and
  it will be used by any Lua clients that you build, to ensure consistency.
  Further customization is available to experts by editing the Lua sources.

<H3><A NAME="other">Building Lua on other systems</A></H3>
<P>
  If you're not using the usual Unix tools, then the instructions for
  building Lua depend on the compiler you use. You'll need to create
  projects (or whatever your compiler uses) for building the library,
  the interpreter, and the compiler, as follows:

<DL CLASS="display">
<DT>
library:
<DD>
lapi.c lcode.c lctype.c ldebug.c ldo.c ldump.c lfunc.c lgc.c llex.c
lmem.c lobject.c lopcodes.c lparser.c lstate.c lstring.c ltable.c
ltm.c lundump.c lvm.c lzio.c
lauxlib.c lbaselib.c lbitlib.c lcorolib.c ldblib.c liolib.c
lmathlib.c loslib.c lstrlib.c ltablib.c lutf8lib.c loadlib.c linit.c
<DT>
interpreter:
<DD>
  library, lua.c
<DT>
compiler:
<DD>
  library, luac.c
</DL>

<P>
  To use Lua as a library in your own programs you'll need to know how to
  create and use libraries with your compiler. Moreover, to dynamically load
  C libraries for Lua you'll need to know how to create dynamic libraries
  and you'll need to make sure that the Lua API functions are accessible to
  those dynamic libraries &mdash; but <EM>don't</EM> link the Lua library
  into each dynamic library. For Unix, we recommend that the Lua library
  be linked statically into the host program and its symbols exported for
  dynamic linking; <TT>src/Makefile</TT> does this for the Lua interpreter.
  For Windows, we recommend that the Lua library be a DLL.
  In all cases, the compiler luac should be linked statically.

<P>
  As mentioned above, you may edit <TT>src/luaconf.h</TT> to customize
  some features before building Lua.
