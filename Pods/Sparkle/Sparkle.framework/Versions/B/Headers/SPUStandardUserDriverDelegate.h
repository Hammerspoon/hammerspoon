 Handles showing the full release notes to the user.
 
 When a user checks for new updates and no new update is found, Sparkle will offer to show the application's version history to the user
 by providing a "Version History" button in the no new update available alert.
 
 If this delegate method is not implemented, Sparkle will instead offer to open the
 `fullReleaseNotesLink` (or `releaseNotesLink` if the former is unavailable) from the appcast's latest `item` in the user's web browser.
 
 If this delegate method is implemented, Sparkle will instead ask the delegate to show the full release notes to the user.
 A delegate may want to implement this method if they want to show in-app or offline release notes.
 
 @param item The appcast item corresponding to the latest version available.
