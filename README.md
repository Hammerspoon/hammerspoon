# Hammerspoon

## What is Hammerspoon?

This is a tool for powerful automation of OS X. At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine.
What gives Hammerspoon its power is a set of extensions that expose specific pieces of system functionality, to the user.

## How do I install it?

Grab the latest release from the github releases page, or use the download button on http://www.hammerspoon.org/ then drag the application to `/Applications/`.

## How do I use it?

Hammerspoon is controlled by the config you write in ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua - you can place any Lua script you like in there, using the APIs that Hammerspoon provides. You can find this documentation at http://www.hammerspoon.org/

If you need a reference for the Lua scripting language, see http://www.lua.org/docs.html

## How can I contribute?

More extensions will always be a huge benefit to Hammerspoon. They can either be pure Lua scripts that offer useful helper functions, or you can write Objective-C extensions to expose new areas of system functionality to users. For more information, see CONTRIBUTING.md

## Where can I get help?
