We've now combined all our supported platforms into a single podspec. As a result, we moved our submit script to a new location for Cocoapods projects: ${PODS_ROOT}/Crashlytics/submit. To avoid breaking functionality that references the old location of the submit, we've placed this dummy script that calls to the correct location, while providing a helpful warning if it is invoked. This bridge for backwards compatibility will be removed in a future release, so please heed the warning!
