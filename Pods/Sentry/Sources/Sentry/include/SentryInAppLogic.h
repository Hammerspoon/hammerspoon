/**
 * This class detects whether a framework belongs to the app or not. We differentiate between three
 * different types of frameworks.
 *
 * First, the main executable of the app, which's name can be retrieved by @c CFBundleExecutable. To
 * mark this framework as "in-app" the caller needs to pass in the @c CFBundleExecutable to
 * @c inAppIncludes.
 *
 * Next, there are private frameworks embedded in the application bundle. Both app supporting
 * frameworks as CocoaLumberJack, Sentry, RXSwift, etc., and frameworks written by the user fall
 * into this category. These frameworks can be both "in-app" or not. As we expect most frameworks of
 * this category to be supporting frameworks, we mark them not as "in-app". If a user wants such a
 * framework to be "in-app", they need to pass the name into @c inAppIncludes. For dynamic
 * frameworks, the location is usually in the bundle under
 * /Frameworks/FrameworkName.framework/FrameworkName. As for static frameworks, the location is the
 * same as the main executable; this class marks all static frameworks as "in-app". To remove static
 * frameworks from being "in-app", Sentry uses stack trace grouping rules on the server.
 *
 * Last, this class marks all public frameworks as not "in-app". Such frameworks are bound
 * dynamically and are usually located at /Library/Frameworks or ~/Library/Frameworks. For
 * simulators, the location can be something like
 * /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS.simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot/System/Library/...
