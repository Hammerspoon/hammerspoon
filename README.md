# Hammerspoon
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon)

## What is Hammerspoon?

This is a tool for powerful automation of OS X. At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine.

What gives Hammerspoon its power is a set of extensions that expose specific pieces of system functionality, to the user. With these, you can write Lua scripts to control many aspects of your OS X environment.

## How do I install it?

 * Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/releases/latest)
 * Drag `Hammerspoon.app` from your `Downloads` folder to `Applications`

## What next?

We have a [Getting Started Guide](http://www.hammerspoon.org/go/), extensive [API docs](http://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/), a [FAQ](http://www.hammerspoon.org/faq/), a [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for developers looking to get involved, and an IRC channel for general chat/support/development (#hammerspoon on Freenode).

## What is the history of the project?

Hammerspoon is a fork of [Mjolnir](https://github.com/sdegutis/mjolnir) by Steven Degutis. Mjolnir aims to be a very minimal application, with its extensions hosted externally and managed using a Lua package manager. We wanted to provide a more integrated experience.

## What is the future of the project?

Our intentions for Hammerspoon broadly fall into these categories:
 * Ever wider coverage of system APIs in Extensions
 * Tighter integration between extensions
 * Smoother user experience
