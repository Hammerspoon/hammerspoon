--- === hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua ===
---
--- Provides support functions in the `cgilua` module for Hammerspoon Minimal Web Server Lua templates.
---
--- This file contains functions which attempt to mimic as closely as possible the functions available to lua template files in the CGILua module provided by the Kepler Project at http://keplerproject.github.io/cgilua/index.html
---
--- The goal of this file is to provide most of the same functionality that CGILua does for template files. Any differences in the results or errors are most likely due to this code and you should direct all error reports or code change suggestions to the Hammerspoon GitHub repository.
---
--- **Do not include this file directly in your Lua templates.**  This library is provided automatically in the `cgilua` table (module) in Lua template web server files.  This submodule will only work from within that environment and should not be used in any other code.

local cgilua = {}

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.print(...) -> nil
--- Function
--- Appends the given arguments to the response body.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * ... - a list of comma separated arguments to add to the response body
---
--- Returns:
---  * None
---
--- Notes:
---  * Available within a lua template file as `cgilua.print`
---  * This function works like the lua builtin `print` command in that it converts all its arguments to strings, separates them with tabs (`\t`), and ends the line with a newline (`\n`) before appending them to the current response body.
cgilua.print = function(_parent, ...)
    local args = { ... }
    for i = 1, select("#",...) do
        args[i] = tostring(args[i])
    end
    _parent.response.body = _parent.response.body .. table.concat(args, "\t") .. "\n"
end

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.put(...) -> nil
--- Function
--- Appends the given arguments to the response body.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * ... - a list of comma separated arguments to add to the response body
---
--- Returns:
---  * None
---
--- Notes:
---  * Available within a lua template file as `cgilua.put`
---  * This function works by flattening tables and converting all values except for `nil` and `false` to their string representation and then appending them in order to the response body. Unlike `cgilua.print`, it does not separate values with a tab character or terminate the line with a newline character.
cgilua.put = function(_parent, ...)
    for _, s in ipairs{ ... } do
        if type(s) == "table" then
            cgilua.put(_parent, table.unpack(s))
        elseif s then
            _parent.response.body = _parent.response.body .. tostring(s)
        end
    end
end

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.errorlog(msg) -> nil
--- Function
--- Sends the message to the `hs.httpserver.hsminweb` log, tagged as an error.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * msg - the message to send to the module's error log
---
--- Returns:
---  * None
---
--- Notes:
---  * Available within a lua template file as `cgilua.errorlog`
---  * By default, messages logged with this method will appear in the Hammerspoon console and are available in the `hs.logger` history.
cgilua.errorlog = function(_parent, string) _parent.log.e(string) end


--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.tmp_path
--- Variable
--- The directory used by `cgilua.tmpfile`
---
--- This variable contains the location where temporary files should be created.  Defaults to the user's temporary directory as returned by `hs.fs.temporaryDirectory`.
cgilua.tmp_path = require"hs.fs".temporaryDirectory():match("^(.*)/")

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.tmpname() -> string
--- Function
--- Returns a temporary file name used by `cgilua.tmpfile`.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * a temporary filename, without the path.
---
--- Notes:
---  * This function uses `hs.host.globallyUniqueString` to generate a unique file name.
cgilua.tmpname = function()
    return "lua_" .. require"hs.host".globallyUniqueString()
end


--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.tmpfile([dir], [namefunction]) -> file[, err]
--- Function
--- Returns the file handle to a temporary file for writing, or nil and an error message if the file could not be created for any reason.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * dir          - the system directory where the temporary file should be created.  Defaults to `cgilua.tmp_path`.
---  * namefunction - an optional function used to generate unique file names for use as temporary files.  Defaults to `cgilua.tmpname`.
---
--- Returns:
---  * the created file's handle and the filename or nil and an error message if the file could not be created.
---
--- Notes:
---  * The file is automatically deleted when the HTTP request has been completed, so if you need for the data to persist, make sure to `io.flush` or `io.close` the file handle yourself and copy the file to a more permanent location.
cgilua.tmpfile = function(_parent, dir, namefunction)
    dir = dir or cgilua.tmp_path
    namefunction = namefunction or cgilua.tmpname
    local tempname = namefunction()
    local filename = dir.."/"..tempname
    local file, err = io.open(filename, "w+b")
    if file then
        table.insert(_parent._tmpfiles, {name = filename, file = file})
        err = filename
    end
    return file, err
end

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.servervariable(varname) -> string
--- Function
--- Returns a string with the value of the CGI environment variable correspoding to varname.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * varname - the name of the CGI variable to get the value of.
---
--- Returns:
---  * the value of the CGI variable as a string, or nil if no such variable exists.
---
--- Notes:
---  * CGI Variables include server defined values commonly shared with CGI scripts and the HTTP request headers from the web request.  The server variables include the following (note that depending upon the request and type of resource the URL refers to, not all values may exist for every request):
---    * "AUTH_TYPE"         - If the server supports user authentication, and the script is protected, this is the protocol-specific authentication method used to validate the user.
---    * "CONTENT_LENGTH"    - The length of the content itself as given by the client.
---    * "CONTENT_TYPE"      - For queries which have attached information, such as HTTP POST and PUT, this is the content type of the data.
---    * "DOCUMENT_ROOT"     - the real directory on the server that corresponds to a DOCUMENT_URI of "/".  This is the first directory which contains files or sub-directories which are served by the web server.
---    * "DOCUMENT_URI"      - the path portion of the HTTP URL requested
---    * "GATEWAY_INTERFACE" - The revision of the CGI specification to which this server complies. Format: CGI/revision
---    * "PATH_INFO"         - The extra path information, as given by the client. In other words, scripts can be accessed by their virtual pathname, followed by extra information at the end of this path. The extra information is sent as PATH_INFO. This information should be decoded by the server if it comes from a URL before it is passed to the CGI script.
---    * "PATH_TRANSLATED"   - The server provides a translated version of PATH_INFO, which takes the path and does any virtual-to-physical mapping to it.
---    * "QUERY_STRING"      - The information which follows the "?" in the URL which referenced this script. This is the query information. It should not be decoded in any fashion. This variable should always be set when there is query information, regardless of command line decoding.
---    * "REMOTE_ADDR"       - The IP address of the remote host making the request.
---    * "REMOTE_HOST"       - The hostname making the request. If the server does not have this information, it should set REMOTE_ADDR and leave this unset.
---    * "REMOTE_IDENT"      - If the HTTP server supports RFC 931 identification, then this variable will be set to the remote user name retrieved from the server. Usage of this variable should be limited to logging only.
---    * "REMOTE_USER"       - If the server supports user authentication, and the script is protected, this is the username they have authenticated as.
---    * "REQUEST_METHOD"    - The method with which the request was made. For HTTP, this is "GET", "HEAD", "POST", etc.
---    * "REQUEST_TIME"      - the time the server received the request represented as the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.  Usable with `os.date` to provide the date and time in whatever format you require.
---    * "REQUEST_URI"       - the DOCUMENT_URI with any query string present in the request appended.  Usually this corresponds to the URL without the scheme or host information.
---    * "SCRIPT_FILENAME"   - the actual path to the script being executed.
---    * "SCRIPT_NAME"       - A virtual path to the script being executed, used for self-referencing URLs.
---    * "SERVER_NAME"       - The server's hostname, DNS alias, or IP address as it would appear in self-referencing URLs.
---    * "SERVER_PORT"       - The port number to which the request was sent.
---    * "SERVER_PROTOCOL"   - The name and revision of the information protcol this request came in with. Format: protocol/revision
---    * "SERVER_SOFTWARE"   - The name and version of the web server software answering the request (and running the gateway). Format: name/version
---
--- * The HTTP Request header names are prefixed with "HTTP_", converted to all uppercase, and have all hyphens converted into underscores.  Common headers (converted to their CGI format) might include, but are not limited to:
---    * HTTP_ACCEPT, HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING, HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE, HTTP_CACHE_CONTROL, HTTP_CONNECTION, HTTP_DNT, HTTP_HOST, HTTP_USER_AGENT
---  * This server also defines the following (which are replicated in the CGI variables above, so those should be used for portability):
---    * HTTP_X_REMOTE_ADDR, HTTP_X_REMOTE_PORT, HTTP_X_SERVER_ADDR, HTTP_X_SERVER_PORT
---  * A list of common request headers and their definitions can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields
cgilua.servervariable = function(_parent, varname)
    return _parent.CGIVariables[varname]
end

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.splitonlast(path) -> directory, file
--- Function
--- Returns two strings with the "directory path" and "file" parts of the given path string splitted on the last separator ("/" or "\").
---
--- Parameters:
---  * path - the path to split
---
--- Returns:
---  * the directory path, the file
---
--- Notes:
---  * This function used to be called cgilua.splitpath and still can be accessed by this name for compatibility reasons. cgilua.splitpath may be deprecated in future versions.
cgilua.splitonlast  = function(_, path) return path:match("^(.-)([^:/\\]*)$") end
cgilua.splitpath    = cgilua.splitonlast -- compatibility with previous versions

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.splitfirst(path) -> path component, path remainder
--- Function
--- Returns two strings with the "first directory" and the "remaining paht" of the given path string splitted on the first separator ("/" or "\").
---
--- Parameters:
---  * path - the path to split
---
--- Returns:
---  * the first directory component, the remainder of the path
cgilua.splitonfirst = function(_, path) return path:match("^/([^:/\\]*)(.*)") end

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.script_path
--- Variable
--- The system path of the running script. Equivalent to the CGI environment variable SCRIPT_FILENAME.
---
--- Notes:
---  * CGILua supports being invoked through a URL that amounts to set of chained paths and script names; this is not necessary for this module, so these variables may differ somewhat from a true CGILua installation; the intent of the variable has been maintained as closely as I can determine at present.  If this changes, so will this documentation.

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.script_file
--- Variable
--- The file name of the running script. Obtained from cgilua.script_path.
---
--- Notes:
---  * CGILua supports being invoked through a URL that amounts to set of chained paths and script names; this is not necessary for this module, so these variables may differ somewhat from a true CGILua installation; the intent of the variable has been maintained as closely as I can determine at present.  If this changes, so will this documentation.

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.script_pdir
--- Variable
--- The directory of the running script. Obtained from cgilua.script_path.
---
--- Notes:
---  * CGILua supports being invoked through a URL that amounts to set of chained paths and script names; this is not necessary for this module, so these variables may differ somewhat from a true CGILua installation; the intent of the variable has been maintained as closely as I can determine at present.

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.script_vpath
--- Variable
--- Equivalent to the CGI environment variable PATH_INFO or "/", if no PATH_INFO is set.
---
--- Notes:

If this changes, so will this documentation.

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.script_vdir
--- Variable
--- If PATH_INFO represents a directory (i.e. ends with "/"), then this is equal to `cgilua.script_vpath`.  Otherwise, this contains the directory portion of `cgilua.script_vpath`.
---
--- Notes:
---  * CGILua supports being invoked through a URL that amounts to set of chained paths and script names; this is not necessary for this module, so these variables may differ somewhat from a true CGILua installation; the intent of the variable has been maintained as closely as I can determine at present.  If this changes, so will this documentation.

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.urlpath
--- Variable
--- The name of the script as requested in the URL. Equivalent to the CGI environment variable SCRIPT_NAME.
---
--- Notes:
---  * CGILua supports being invoked through a URL that amounts to set of chained paths and script names; this is not necessary for this module, so these variables may differ somewhat from a true CGILua installation; the intent of the variable has been maintained as closely as I can determine at present.

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.doscript(filename) -> results
--- Function
--- Executes a lua file (given by filepath).
---
--- Parameters:
---  * filepath - the file to interpret as Lua code
---
--- Returns:
---  * the values returned by the execution, or nil followed by an error message if the file does not exists.
---
--- Notes:
---  * If the file does not exist, an Internal Server error is returned to the client and an error is logged to the Hammerspoon console.
---  * During the processing of a web request, the local directory is temporarily changed to match the local directory of the path of the file being served, as determined by the URL of the request.  This is usually different than the Hammerspoon default directory which corresponds to the directory which contains the `init.lua` file for Hammerspoon.
cgilua.doscript = function(_parent, filename)
    local f, err = loadfile(filename, "bt", _parent.__luaInternal_cgiluaENV)
    if not f then
        error(string.format("Cannot execute '%s'. Exiting.\n%s", filename, err), 3)
    else
        local results = { xpcall(f, _parent.__luaInternal_cgiluaENV.cgilua._errorhandler) }
        local ok = table.remove(results, 1)
        if ok then
            if #results == 0 then results = { true } end
            return table.unpack(results)
        else
            error(table.unpack(results), 3)
        end
    end
end

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.doif(filename) -> results
--- Function
--- Executes a lua file (given by filepath) if it exists.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * filepath - the file to interpret as Lua code
---
--- Returns:
---  * the values returned by the execution, or nil followed by an error message if the file does not exists.
---
--- Notes:
---  * This function only interprets the file if it exists; if the file does not exist, it returns an error to the calling code (not the web client)
---  * During the processing of a web request, the local directory is temporarily changed to match the local directory of the path of the file being served, as determined by the URL of the request.  This is usually different than the Hammerspoon default directory which corresponds to the directory which contains the `init.lua` file for Hammerspoon.
cgilua.doif = function(_parent, filename)
        if not filename then return end    -- no file
        local f, err = io.open(filename)
        if not f then return nil, err end    -- no file (or unreadable file)
        f:close()
        return cgilua.doscript(_parent, filename)
end

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.contentheader(maintype, subtype) -> none
--- Function
--- Sets the HTTP response type for the content being generated to maintype/subtype.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * maintype - the primary content type (e.g. "text")
---  * subtype  - the sub-type for the content (e.g. "plain")
---
--- Returns:
---  * None
---
--- Notes:
---  * This sets the `Content-Type` header field for the HTTP response being generated.  This will override any previous setting, including the default of "text/html".
cgilua.contentheader = function(_parent, mainType, subType)
    _parent.response.headers["Content-Type"] = tostring(mainType) .. "/" .. tostring(subType)
end

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.htmlheader() -> none
--- Function
--- Sets the HTTP response type to "text/html"
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * None
---
--- Notes:
---  * This sets the `Content-Type` header field for the HTTP response being generated to "text/html".  This is the default value, so generally you should not need to call this function unless you have previously changed it with the [cgilua.contentheader](#contentheader) function.
cgilua.htmlheader = function(_parent)
    _parent.response.headers["Content-Type"] = "text/html"
end

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.header(key, value) -> none
--- Function
--- Sets the HTTP response header `key` to `value`
---
--- Parameters:
---  * key - the HTTP response header to set a value to.  This should be a string.
---  * value - the value for the header.  This should be a string or a value representable as a string.
---
--- Returns:
---  * None
---
--- Notes:
---  * You should not use this function to set the value for the "Content-Type" key; instead use [cgilua.contentheader](#contentheader) or [cgilua.htmlheader](#htmlheader).
cgilua.header = function(_parent, key, value)
     _parent.response.headers[key] = value
end

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.redirect(url, [args]) -> none
--- Function
--- Sends the headers to force a redirection to the given URL adding the parameters in table args to the new URL.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * url  - the URL the client should be redirected to
---  * args - an optional table which should have key-value pairs that will be encoded to form a valid query at the end of the URL (see [cgilua.urlcode.encodetable](#encodetable).
---
--- Returns:
---  * None
---
--- Notes:
---  * This function should generally be followed by a `return` in your lua template page as no additional processing or output should occur when a request is to be redirected.
cgilua.redirect = function(_parent, url, args)
    if not url:find("^https?:") then
        if url:find("^/") then
            url = _parent.CGIVariables.REQUEST_SCHEME .. "://" .. _parent.CGIVariables.HTTP_HOST .. url
        else
            url = _parent.CGIVariables.REQUEST_SCHEME .. "://" .. _parent.CGIVariables.HTTP_HOST .. "/" .. table.concat(_parent.request.headers._.pathParts.pathComponents, "/", 2, #_parent.request.headers._.pathParts.pathComponents - 1) .. url
        end
    end
    local params = ""
    if args then
        params = "?" .. cgilua.urlcode.encodetable(_parent, args)
    end
    _parent.response.code = 307
    _parent.response.headers["Location"] = url .. params
end

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.mkabsoluteurl(uri) -> string
--- Function
--- Returns an absolute URL for the given URI by prepending the path with the scheme, hostname, and port of this web server.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * URI - A path to a resource served by this web server.  A "/" will be prepended to the path if it is not present.
---
--- Returns:
---  * An absolute URL for the given path of the form "scheme://hostname:port/path" where `scheme` will be either "http" or "https", and the hostname and port will match that of this web server.
---
--- Notes:
---  * If you wish to append query items to the path or expand a relative path into it's full path, see [cgilua.mkurlpath](#mkurlpath).
cgilua.mkabsoluteurl = function(_parent, path)
    if path:sub(1,1) ~= '/' then
        path = '/'..path
    end
    return string.format("%s://%s:%s%s",
        _parent.CGIVariables.REQUEST_SCHEME,
        _parent.CGIVariables.SERVER_NAME,
        _parent.CGIVariables.SERVER_PORT,
        path)
end

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.mkurlpath(uri, [args]) -> string
--- Function
--- Creates a full document URI from a partial URI, including query arguments if present.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * uri  - the full or partial URI (path and file component of a URL) of the document
---  * args - an optional table which should have key-value pairs that will be encoded to form a valid query at the end of the URI (see [cgilua.urlcode.encodetable](#encodetable).
---
--- Returns:
---  * A full URI including any query arguments, if present.
---
--- Notes:
---  * This function is intended to be used in conjunction with [cgilua.mkabsoluteurl](#mkabsoluteurl) to generate a full URL.  If the `uri` provided does not begin with a "/", then the current directory path is prepended to the uri and any query arguments are appended.
---  * e.g. `cgilua.mkabsoluteurl(cgiurl.mkurlpath("file.lp", { key = value, ... }))` will return a full URL specifying the file `file.lp` in the current directory with the specified key-value pairs as query arguments.
cgilua.mkurlpath = function(_parent, script, args)
    local params = ""
    if args then
        params = "?" .. cgilua.urlcode.encodetable(_parent, args)
    end
    local urldir = _parent.__luaInternal_cgiluaENV.cgilua.urlpath:match("^(.-)[^:/\\]*$")

--- === hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.urlcode ===
---
--- Support functions for the CGILua compatibility module for encoding and decoding URL components in accordance with RFC 3986.

--- Parameters:
---  * string - the string to encode
---
--- Returns:
---  * a string with non-alphanumeric characters percent encoded and spaces converted into "+" as per RFC 3986.
---
--- Notes:
---  * this function assumes that the provided string is a single component and URL encodes *all* non-alphanumeric characters.  Do not use this function to generate a URL query string -- use [cgilua.urlcode.encodetable](#encodetable).
cgilua.urlcode.escape = function(_, str)
    return (str:gsub("\n", "\r\n"):gsub("([^0-9a-zA-Z ])", function(_) return string.format("%%%02X", string.byte(_)) end):gsub(" ", "+"))

---
--- Parameters:
---  * table - a table of key-value pairs to be converted into a query string
---
--- Returns:
---  * a query string as specified in RFC 3986.
---
--- Notes:
---  * the string will be of the form: "key1=value1&key2=value2..." where all of the keys and values are properly escaped using [cgilua.urlcode.escape](#escape).  If you are crafting a URL by hand, the result of this function should be appended to the end of the URL after a "?" character to specify where the query string begins.

--- Notes:
---  * If the key already exists in the table, its value is converted to a table (if it isn't already) and the new value is added to the end of the array of values for the key.
---  * This function is used internally by [cgilua.urlcode.parsequery](#parsequery) or can be used to prepare a table of key-value pairs for [cgilua.urlcode.encodetable](#encodetable).
cgilua.urlcode.insertfield = function(_, args, name, value)
    if not args[name] then
        args[name] = value
    else
        local t = type(args[name])
        if t ~= "table" then
            args[name] = {
              args[name],

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.urlcode.parsequery(query, table) -> none
--- Function
--- Parse the query string and store the key-value pairs in the provided table.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * query - a URL encoded query string, either from a URL or from the body of a POST request encoded in the "x-www-form-urlencoded" format.
---  * table - the table to add the key-value pairs to
---
--- Returns:
---  * None
---
--- Notes:
---  * The specification allows for the same key to be assigned multiple values in an encoded string, but does not specify the behavior; by convention, web servers assign these multiple values to the same key in an array (table).  This function follows that convention.  This is most commonly used by forms which allow selecting multiple options via check boxes or in a selection list.
---  * This function uses [cgilua.urlcode.insertfield](#insertfield) to build the key-value table.
cgilua.urlcode.parsequery = function(_parent, query, args)
    if type(query) == "string" then
        query:gsub("([^&=]+)=([^&=]*)&?",
            function(key, val)
                cgilua.urlcode.insertfield(_parent, args, cgilua.urlcode.unescape(_parent, key), cgilua.urlcode.unescape(_parent, val))
            end)
    end
end

local out = function(s, i, f)
    if type(s) ~= "string" then s = tostring(s) end
    s = s:sub(i, f or -1)
    if s == "" then return s end
    -- we could use `%q' here, but this way we have better control
    s = s:gsub("([\\\n\'])", "\\%1")
    -- substitute '\r' by '\'+'r' and let `loadstring' reconstruct it
    s = s:gsub("\r", "\\r")
    return string.format(" %s('%s'); ", "cgilua.put", s)

--- === hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.lp ===
---
--- Support functions for the CGILua compatibility module for including and translating Lua template pages into Lua code for execution within the Hammerspoon environment to provide dynamic content for http requests.
---
--- The most commonly used function is likely to be [cgilua.lp.include](#include), which allows including a template driven file during rendering so that common code can be reused more easily.  While passing in your own environment table for upvalues is possible, this is not recommended for general use because the default environment passed to each included file ensures that all server variables and the CGILua compatibility functions are available with the same names, and any new non-local (i.e. "global") variable defined are shared with the calling environment and not shared with the Hammerspoon global environment.
---
--- If your template file requires the ability to create variables in the Hammerspoon global environment, access the global environment directly through `_G`.
---
--- Note that the above considerations only apply to creating new "global" variables.  Any currently defined global variables (for example, the `hs` table where Hammerspoon module functions are stored) are available within the template file as long as no local or CGILua environment variable shares the same name (e.g. `_G["hs"]` and `hs` refer to the same table.
---
--- See the documentation for the [cgilua.lp.include](#include) for more information.

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.lp.translate(source) -> luaCode
--- Function
--- Converts the specified Lua template source into Lua code executable within the Hammerspoon environment.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * source - a string containing the contents of a Lua/HTML template to be converted into true Lua code
---
--- Returns:
---  * The lua code corresponding to the provided source which can be fed into the `load` lua builtin to generate a Lua function.
---
--- Notes:
---  * This function is used internally by [cgilua.lp.include](#include), and probably won't be useful unless you want to translate a dynamically generated template -- which has security implications, depending upon what inputs you use to generate this template, because the resulting Lua code will execute within your Hammerspoon environment.  Be very careful about your inputs if you choose to ignore this warning.
---  * To ensure that the translated code has access to the `cgilua` support functions, pass `_ENV` as the environment argument to the `load` lua builtin; otherwise any output generated by the resulting function will be sent to the Hammerspoon console and not included in the HTTP response sent back to the client.
cgilua.lp.translate = function(_, source)
    -- in an effort to attempt to maintain compatibility with CGILua, we should expect/allow the same things in a source file...

    -- compatibility with earlier versions...
    -- translates $| lua-var |$
    source = source:gsub("$|(.-)|%$", "<?lua = %1 ?>")
    -- translates <!--$$ lua-code $$-->
    source = source:gsub("<!%-%-$$(.-)$$%-%->", "<?lua %1 ?>")
    -- translates <% lua-code %>
    source = source:gsub("<%%(.-)%%>", "<?lua %1 ?>")

    local res = {}
    local start = 1   -- start of untranslated part in `s'
    while true do
        local ip, fp, target, exp, code = source:find("<%?(%w*)[ \t]*(=?)(.-)%?>", start)
        if not ip then break end
        table.insert(res, out(source, start, ip-1))
        if target ~= "" and target ~= "lua" then
            -- not for Lua; pass whole instruction to the output
            table.insert(res, out(source, ip, fp))
        else
            if exp == "=" then   -- expression?
                table.insert(res, string.format(" %s(%s);", "cgilua.put", code))

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.lp.compile(source, name, [env]) -> function
--- Function
--- Converts the specified Lua template source into a Lua function.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * source - a string containing the contents of a Lua/HTML template to be converted into a function
---  * name   - a label used in an error message if execution of the returned function results in a run-time error
---  * env    - an optional table specifying the environment to be used by the lua builtin function `load` when converting the source into a function.  By default, the function will inherit its caller's environment.
---
--- Returns:
---  * A lua function which should take no arguments.
---
--- Notes:
---  * The source provided is first compared to a stored cache of previously translated templates and will re-use an existing translation if the template has been seen before.  If the source is unique, [cgilua.lp.translate](#translate) is called on the template source.
---  * This function is used internally by [cgilua.lp.include](#include), and probably won't be useful unless you want to translate a dynamically generated template -- which has security implications, depending upon what inputs you use to generate this template, because the resulting Lua code will execute within your Hammerspoon environment.  Be very careful about your inputs if you choose to ignore this warning.
cgilua.lp.compile = function(_parent, string, chunkname, env)
    local s = _parent.__luaCached_translations[string]
    if not s then
          s = cgilua.lp.translate(_parent, string)
          _parent.__luaCached_translations[string] = s
    end
    local f, err = load(s, chunkname, "bt", env or _parent.__luaInternal_cgiluaENV)
    if not f then error(err, 3) end
    return f
end

--- hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.lp.include(file, [env]) -> none
--- Function
--- Includes the template specified by the `file` parameter.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * file - a string containing the file system path to the template to include.
---  * env  - an optional table specifying the environment to be used by the included template.  By default, the template will inherit its caller's environment.
---
--- Returns:
---  * None
---
--- Notes:
--- * This function is called by the web server to process the template specified by the requested URL.  Subsequent invocations of this function can be used to include common or re-used code from other template files and will be included in-line where the `cgilua.lp.include` function is invoked in the originating template.
---  * During the processing of a web request, the local directory is temporarily changed to match the local directory of the path of the file being served, as determined by the URL of the request.  This is usually different than the Hammerspoon default directory which corresponds to the directory which contains the `init.lua` file for Hammerspoon.
---
--- * The default template environment provides the following:
---   * the `__index` metamethod points to the `_G` environment variable in the Hammerspoon Lua instance; this means that any global variable in the Hammerspoon environment is available to the lua code in a template file.
---   * the `__newindex` metamethod points to a function which creates new "global" variables in the template files environment; this means that if a template includes another template file, and that second template file creates a "global" variable, that new variable will be available in the environment of the calling template, but will not be shared with the Hammerspoon global variable space;  "global" variables created in this manner will be released when the HTTP request is completed.
---
---   * `print` is overridden so that its output is streamed into the response body to be returned when the web request completes.  It follows the traditional pattern of the `print` builtin function: multiple arguments are separated by a tab character, the output is terminated with a new-line character, non-string arguments are converted to strings via the `tostring` builtin function.
---   * `write` is defined as an alternative to `print` and differs in the following ways from the `print` function described above:  no intermediate tabs or newline are included in the output streamed to the response body.
---   * `cgilua` is defined as a table containing all of the functions included in this support sub-module.
---   * `hsminweb` is defined as a table which contains the following tables which may be of use:
---     * CGIVariables - a table containing key-value pairs of the same data available through the [cgilua.servervariable](#servervariable) function.
---     * id           - a string, generated via `hs.host.globallyUniqueString`, unique to this specific HTTP request.
---     * log          - a table/object representing the `hs.httpserver.hsminweb` instance of `hs.logger`.  This can be used to log messages to the Hammerspoon console as described in the documentation for `hs.logger`.
---     * request      - a table containing data representing the details of the HTTP request as it was made by the web client to the server.  The following keys are commonly found:
---       * headers - a table containing key-value pairs representing the headers included in the HTTP request; unlike the values available through [cgilua.servervariable](#servervariable) or found in `CGIVariables`, these are available in their raw form.
---         * this table also contains a table with the key "_".  This table contains functions and data used internally, and is described more fully in a supporting document (TBD).  It is targeted primarily at custom error functions designed for use with `hs.httpserver.hsminweb` and should not generally be necessary for Lua template files.
---       * method  - the method of the HTTP request, most commonly "GET" or "POST"
---       * path    - the path portion of the requested URL.
---     * response     - a table containing data representing the response being formed for the response to the HTTP request.  This is generally handled for you by the `cgilua` support functions, but for special cases, you can modify it directly; this should contain only the following keys:
---       * body    - a string containing the response body.  As the lua template outputs content, this string is appended to.
---       * code    - an integer representing the currently expected response code for the HTTP request.
---       * headers - a table containing key-value pairs of the currently defined response headers
---     * _tmpfiles    - used internally to track temporary files used in the completion of this HTTP request; do not modify directly.
