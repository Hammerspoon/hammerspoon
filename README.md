## What is Hammerspoon?

This is a tool for powerful automation of OS X. At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine.
What gives Hammerspoon its power is a set of extensions that expose specific pieces of system functionality, to the user. With these, you can write Lua scripts to control many aspects of your OS X environment.

## How do I install it?

 * Visit:
  * https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/releases/latest
 * Download the zip
 * Drag `Hammerspoon.app` from your `Downloads` folder to `Applications`

## What next?

We have a Getting Started Guide, API docs, a FAQ, Contribution Guide and how to ask for help, at http://www.hammerspoon.org

## What is the history of the project?

Hammerspoon is a fork of [Mjolnir](https://github.com/sdegutis/mjolnir) by Steven Degutis. Mjolnir aims to be a very minimal application, with its extensions hosted externally and managed using a Lua package manager. We felt that we wanted to take the project in a different direction to its maintainer, so the fork was born.

## What is the future of the project?

Our intentions for Hammerspoon broadly fall into these categories:
 * Ever wider coverage of system APIs in Extensions
 * Tighter integration between extensions
 * Smoother user experience (e.g. signed releases, easier access to documentation, easier discovery of extensions)
