 * Show the user a new update is found.

 *
 *  The potential  `stage`s on the updater @c state are:
 *
 *  `SPUUpdateStateNotDownloaded` - Update has not been downloaded yet.
 *
 *  `SPUUpdateStateDownloaded` - Update has already been downloaded but not started installing yet.
 *
 *  `SPUUpdateStateInstalling` - Update has been downloaded and already started installing.
 *
 *  The `userIntiated` property on the @c state indicates if the update was initiated by the user or if it was automatically scheduled in the background.
 *
 *  Additionally, these properties on the @c appcastItem are of importance:
 *
 *  @c appcastItem.informationOnlyUpdate indicates if the update is only informational and should not be downloaded. You can direct the user to the infoURL property of the appcastItem in their web browser. Sometimes information only updates are used as a fallback in case a bad update is shipped, so you'll want to support this case.
 *
 *  @c appcastItem.majorUpgrade indicates if the update is a major or paid upgrade.
 *
 *  @c appcastItem.criticalUpdate indicates if the update is a critical update.
 *
 * A reply of `SPUUserUpdateChoiceInstall` begins or resumes downloading or installing the update.
 * If the state.stage is `SPUUserUpdateStateInstalling`, this may send a quit event to the application and relaunch it immediately (in this state, this behaves as a fast "install and Relaunch").
 * Do not use this reply if @c appcastItem.informationOnlyUpdate is YES.
 *
 * A reply of `SPUUserUpdateChoiceDismiss` dismisses the update for the time being. The user may be reminded of the update at a later point.
 * If the state.stage is `SPUUserUpdateStateDownloaded`, the downloaded update is kept after dismissing until the next time an update is shown to the user.
 * If the state.stage is `SPUUserUpdateStateInstalling`, the installing update is also preserved after dismissing. In this state however, the update will also still be installed after the application is terminated.
 *
 * A reply of `SPUUserUpdateChoiceSkip` skips this particular version and won't notify the user again, unless they initiate an update check themselves.
 * If @c appcastItem.majorUpgrade is YES, the major update and any future minor updates to that major release are skipped, unless a future minor update specifies a `<sparkle:ignoreSkippedUpgradesBelowVersion>` requirement.
 * If the state.stage is `SPUUpdateStateInstalling`, the installation is also canceled when the update is skipped.
 *
 * @param appcastItem The Appcast Item containing information that reflects the new update.
 * @param state The current state of the user update. See above discussion for notable properties.
 * @param reply The reply which indicates if the update should be installed, dismissed, or skipped. See above discussion for more details.
