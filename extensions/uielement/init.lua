--- === hs.uielement ===
---
--- A generalized framework for working with OSX UI elements

local uielement = require "hs.uielement.internal"
local application = {}
application.watcher = require "hs.application.watcher"
local fnutils = require "hs.fnutils"


--- hs.uielement:isApplication() -> bool
--- Method
--- Returns whether the UI element represents an application.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * A boolean, true if the UI element is an application
function uielement:isApplication()
    return self:role() == "AXApplication"
end

--- === hs.uielement.watcher ===
---
--- Watch for events on certain UI elements (including windows and applications)
---
--- You can watch the following events:
--- ### Application-level events
--- See hs.application.watcher for more events you can watch.
--- * hs.uielement.watcher.applicationActivated: The current application switched to this one.
--- * hs.uielement.watcher.applicationDeactivated: The current application is no longer this one.
--- * hs.uielement.watcher.applicationHidden: The application was hidden.
--- * hs.uielement.watcher.applicationShown: The application was shown.
---
--- #### Focus change events
--- These events are watched on the application level, but send the relevant child element to the handler.
--- * hs.uielement.watcher.mainWindowChanged: The main window of the application was changed.
--- * hs.uielement.watcher.focusedWindowChanged: The focused window of the application was changed. Note that the application may not be activated itself.
--- * hs.uielement.watcher.focusedElementChanged: The focused UI element of the application was changed.
---
--- ### Window-level events
--- * hs.uielement.watcher.windowCreated: A window was created. You should watch for this event on the application, or the parent window.
--- * hs.uielement.watcher.windowMoved: The window was moved.
--- * hs.uielement.watcher.windowResized: The window was resized.
--- * hs.uielement.watcher.windowMinimized: The window was minimized.
--- * hs.uielement.watcher.windowUnminimized: The window was unminimized.
---
--- ### Element-level events
--- These work on all UI elements, including windows.
--- * hs.uielement.watcher.elementDestroyed: The element was destroyed.
--- * hs.uielement.watcher.titleChanged: The element's title was changed.

--- hs.uielement:newWatcher(handler[, userData]) -> hs.uielement.watcher or nil
--- Constructor
--- Creates a new watcher for the element represented by self (the object the method is being invoked for).
---
--- Parameters:
---  * a function to be called when a watched event occurs.  The argument will be passed the following arguments:
---    * element: The element the event occurred on. Note this is not always the element being watched.
---    * event: The name of the event that occurred.
---    * watcher: The watcher object being created.
---    * userData: The userData you included, if any.
---  * an optional userData object which will be included as the final argument to the callback function when it is called.
---
--- Returns:
---  * An `hs.uielement.watcher` object, or `nil` if an error occurred
function uielement:newWatcher(callback, ...)
    if type(callback) ~= "function" then

--- hs.uielement.watcher:start(events) -> hs.uielement.watcher
--- Method
--- Tells the watcher to start watching for the given list of events.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * An array of events to be watched for.
---
--- Returns:
---  * hs.uielement.watcher
---
--- Notes:
---  * See hs.uielement.watcher for a list of events. You may also specify arbitrary event names as strings.
---  * Does nothing if the watcher has already been started. To start with different events, stop it first.

    -- Actually start the watcher.

end

--- hs.uielement.watcher:stop() -> hs.uielement.watcher
--- Method
--- Tells the watcher to stop listening for events.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * hs.uielement.watcher
---
--- Notes:
---  * This is automatically called if the element is destroyed.

end

--- hs.uielement.watcher:element() -> object
--- Method
--- Returns the element the watcher is watching.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * The element the watcher is watching.
