--- hs.layout.apply(table[, windowTitleComparator])
--- Function
--- Applies a layout to applications/windows
---
--- Parameters:
---  * table - A table describing your desired layout. Each element in the table should be another table describing a set of windows to match, and their desired size/position. The fields in each of these tables are:
---   * A string containing an application name, or an `hs.application` object, or nil
---   * A string containing a window title, or an `hs.window` object, or a function, or nil
---   * A string containing a screen name, or an `hs.screen` object, or a function that accepts no parameters and returns an `hs.screen` object, or nil to select the first available screen
---   * A Unit rect, or a function which is called for each window and returns a unit rect (see `hs.window.moveToUnit()`). The function should accept one parameter, which is the window object.
---   * A Frame rect, or a function which is called for each window and returns a frame rect (see `hs.screen:frame()`). The function should accept one parameter, which is the window object.
---   * A Full-frame rect, of a function which is called for each window and returns a full-frame rect (see `hs.screen:fullFrame()`). The function should accept one parameter, which is the window object.
---  * windowTitleComparator - (optional) Function to use for window title comparison. It is called with two string arguments (below) and its return value is evaluated as a boolean. If no comparator is provided, the '==' operator is used
---   * windowTitle: The `:title()` of the window object being examined
---   * layoutWindowTitle: The window title string (second field) specified in each element of the layout table
---
--- Returns:
---  * None
---
--- Notes:
---  * If the application name argument is nil, window titles will be matched regardless of which app they belong to
---  * If the window title argument is nil, all windows of the specified application will be matched
---  * If the window title argument is a function, the function will be called with the application name argument (which may be nil), and should return a table of `hs.window` objects (even if there is only one window it must be in a table)
---  * You can specify both application name and window title if you want to match only one window of a particular application
---  * If you specify neither application name or window title, no windows will be matched :)
---  * Monitor name is a string, as found in `hs.screen:name()`. You can also pass an `hs.screen` object, or a function that returns an `hs.screen` object. If you pass nil, the first screen will be selected
---  * The final three arguments use `hs.geometry.rect()` objects to describe the desired position and size of matched windows:
---    * Unit rect will be passed to `hs.window.moveToUnit()`
---    * Frame rect will be passed to `hs.window.setFrame()` (including menubar and dock)
---    * Full-frame rect will be passed to `hs.window.setFrame()` (ignoring menubar and dock)
---  * If either the x or y components of frame/full-frame rect are negative, they will be applied as offsets against the opposite edge of the screen (e.g. If x is -100 then the left edge of the window will be 100 pixels from the right edge of the screen)
---  * Only one of the rect arguments will apply to any matched windows. If you specify more than one, the first will win
---  * An example usage:
---
---     ```layout1 = {
---         {"Mail", nil, "Color LCD", hs.layout.maximized, nil, nil},
---         {"Safari", nil, "Thunderbolt Display", hs.layout.maximized, nil, nil},
---         {"iTunes", "iTunes", "Color LCD", hs.layout.maximized, nil, nil},
---         {"iTunes", "MiniPlayer", "Color LCD", nil, nil, hs.geometry.rect(0, -48, 400, 48)},
---       }```
---  * An example of a function that works well as a `windowTitleComparator` is the Lua built-in `string.match`, which uses Lua Patterns to match strings
function layout.apply(theLayout, windowTitleComparator)
-- Layout parameter should be a table where each row takes the form of:
--  {"App name", "Window name","Display Name"/"hs.screen object", "unitrect", "framerect", "fullframerect"},
--  First three items in each row are strings (although the display name can also be an hs.screen object, or nil)
--  Second three items are rects that specify the position of the window. The first one that is
--   not nil, wins.
--  unitrect is a rect passed to window:moveToUnit()
--  framerect is a rect passed to window:setFrame()
--      If either the x or y components of framerect are negative, they will be applied as
--      offsets from the width or height of screen:frame(), respectively
--  fullframerect is a rect passed to window:setFrame()
--      If either the x or y components of fullframerect are negative, they will be applied
--      as offsets from the width or height of screen:fullFrame(), respectively
