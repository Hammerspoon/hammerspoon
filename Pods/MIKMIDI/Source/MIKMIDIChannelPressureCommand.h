/**
 *  A MIDI channel pressure message. This message is most often sent by pressing
 *  down on the key after it "bottoms out". This differs from a MIKMIDIPolyphonicKeyPressureCommand
 *  in that is the single greatest pressure of all currently depressed keys, hence the lack
 *  of a note property.
