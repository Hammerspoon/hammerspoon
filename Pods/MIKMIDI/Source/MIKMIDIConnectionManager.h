/**
 *  MIKMIDIConnectionManager can be used to manage a set of connected devices. It can be configured to automatically
 *  connect to devices as they are added, and disconnect from them as they are removed. It also supports saving
 *  the list of connected to NSUserDefaults and restoring them upon relaunch.
 *
 *  The use of MIKMIDIConnectionManager is optional. It is meant to be useful in implementing functionality that
 *  many MIDI device enabled apps need. However, simple connection to devices or MIDI endpoints can be done with
 *  MIKMIDIDeviceManager directly, if desired.
