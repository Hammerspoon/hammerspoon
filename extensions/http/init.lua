--- === hs.http ===
---
--- Perform HTTP requests

--- hs.http.get(url, headers) -> int, string, table
--- Function
--- Sends an HTTP GET request to a URL
---
--- Parameters
---  * url - A string containing the URL to retrieve
---  * headers - A table containing string keys and values representing the request headers, or nil to add no headers
---
--- Returns:
---  * A number containing the HTTP response status
---  * A string containing the response body
---  * A table containing the response headers
---
--- Notes:
---  * If authentication is required in order to download the request, the required credentials must be specified as part of the URL (e.g. "http://user:password@host.com/"). If authentication fails, or credentials are missing, the connection will attempt to continue without credentials.
---
---  * This function is synchronous and will therefore block all other Lua execution while the request is in progress, you are encouraged to use the asynchronous functions
---  * If you attempt to connect to a local Hammerspoon server created with `hs.httpserver`, then Hammerspoon will block until the connection times out (60 seconds), return a failed result due to the timeout, and then the `hs.httpserver` callback function will be invoked (so any side effects of the function will occur, but it's results will be lost).  Use [hs.http.asyncGet](#asyncGet) to avoid this.
http.get = function(url, headers)
    return http.doRequest(url, "GET", nil, headers)
end

--- hs.http.post(url, data, headers) -> int, string, table
--- Function
--- Sends an HTTP POST request to a URL
---
--- Parameters
---  * url - A string containing the URL to submit to
---  * data - A string containing the request body, or nil to send no body
---  * headers - A table containing string keys and values representing the request headers, or nil to add no headers
---
--- Returns:
---  * A number containing the HTTP response status
---  * A string containing the response body
---  * A table containing the response headers
---
--- Notes:
---  * If authentication is required in order to download the request, the required credentials must be specified as part of the URL (e.g. "http://user:password@host.com/"). If authentication fails, or credentials are missing, the connection will attempt to continue without credentials.

Use [hs.http.asyncPost](#asyncPost) to avoid this.
http.post = function(url, data, headers)
    return http.doRequest(url, "POST", data,headers)
end

--- hs.http.asyncGet(url, headers, callback)
--- Function
--- Sends an HTTP GET request asynchronously
---
--- Parameters:
---  * url - A string containing the URL to retrieve
---  * headers - A table containing string keys and values representing the request headers, or nil to add no headers
---  * callback - A function to be called when the request succeeds or fails. The function will be passed three parameters:
---   * A number containing the HTTP response status
---   * A string containing the response body
---   * A table containing the response headers
---
--- Notes:
---  * If authentication is required in order to download the request, the required credentials must be specified as part of the URL (e.g. "http://user:password@host.com/"). If authentication fails, or credentials are missing, the connection will attempt to continue without credentials.
---
---  * If the request fails, the callback function's first parameter will be negative and the second parameter will contain an error message. The third parameter will be nil
http.asyncGet = function(url, headers, callback)
    http.doAsyncRequest(url, "GET", nil, headers, callback)
end

--- hs.http.asyncPost(url, data, headers, callback)
--- Function
--- Sends an HTTP POST request asynchronously
---
--- Parameters:
---  * url - A string containing the URL to submit to
---  * data - A string containing the request body, or nil to send no body
---  * headers - A table containing string keys and values representing the request headers, or nil to add no headers
---  * callback - A function to be called when the request succeeds or fails. The function will be passed three parameters:
---   * A number containing the HTTP response status
---   * A string containing the response body
---   * A table containing the response headers
---
--- Notes:
---  * If authentication is required in order to download the request, the required credentials must be specified as part of the URL (e.g. "http://user:password@host.com/"). If authentication fails, or credentials are missing, the connection will attempt to continue without credentials.
---
---  * If the request fails, the callback function's first parameter will be negative and the second parameter will contain an error message. The third parameter will be nil
http.asyncPost = function(url, data, headers, callback)
    http.doAsyncRequest(url, "POST", data, headers, callback)
end

--- hs.http.htmlEntities[]
--- Variable
--- A collection of common HTML Entities (&whatever;) and their UTF8 equivalents.  To retrieve the UTF8 sequence for a given entity, reference the table as `hs.http.htmlEntities["&key;"]` where `key` is the text of the entity's name or a numeric reference like `#number`.
---
--- Notes:
---  * This list is likely not complete.  It is based on the list of common entities described at http://www.freeformatter.com/html-entities.html.
---  * Additional entities can be temporarily added via the `hs.http.registerEntity(...)` function.  If you feel you have a more official list of entities which contains items which are currently not included by default, please open up an issue at https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon and your link will be considered.
---  * To see a list of the currently defined entities, a __tostring meta-method is included so that referencing the table directly as a string will return the current definitions.
---    * For reference, this meta-method is essentially the following:
---
---      for i,v in hs.fnutils.sortByKeys(hs.http.htmlEntities) do print(string.format("%-10s %-10s %s\n", i, "&#"..tostring(hs.utf8.codepoint(v))..";", v)) end
---
---    * Note that this list will not include the numeric conversion of entities (e.g. &#65;), as this is handled by an __index metamethod to allow for all possible numeric values.

--- hs.http.registerEntity(entity, codepoint) -> string
--- Function
--- Registers an HTML Entity with the specified Unicode codepoint which can later referenced in your code as `hs.http.htmlEntity[entity]` for convenience and readability.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * entity -- The full text of the HTML Entity as it appears in HTML encoded documents.  A proper entity starts with & and ends with ; and entity labels which do not meet this will have them added -- future dereferences to get the corresponding UTF8 *must* include this initiator and terminator or they will not be recognized.
---  * codepoint -- a Unicode codepoint in numeric or `U+xxxx` format to register with as the given entity.
---
--- Returns:
---  * Returns the UTF8 byte sequence for the entity registered.
---
--- Notes:
---  * If an entity label was previously registered, this will overwrite the previous value with a new one.
---  * The return value is merely syntactic sugar and you do not need to save it locally; it can be safely ignored -- future access to the pre-converted entity should be retrieved as `hs.http.htmlEntities[entity]` in your code.  It looks good when invoked from the console, though ☺.
http.registerEntity = function(label, codepoint)
    local entity = label:match("^&?([^&;]+);?$")
    if not entity then
        return error("Invalid label '"..label.."' provided to hs.http.registerEntity", 2)
    else
        label = "&"..entity..";"
        http.htmlEntities[label] = utf8.codepointToUTF8(codepoint)
        return http.htmlEntities[label]
    end
end

--- hs.http.convertHtmlEntities(inString) -> outString
--- Function
--- Convert all recognized HTML Entities in the `inString` to appropriate UTF8 byte sequences and returns the converted text.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * inString -- A string containing any number of HTML Entities (&whatever;) in the text.
---
--- Returns:
---  * outString -- the input string with all recognized HTML Entity sequences converted to UTF8 byte sequences.
---
--- Notes:
---  * Recognized HTML Entities are those registered in `hs.http.htmlEntities` or numeric entity sequences: &#n; where `n` can be any integer number.
---  * This function is especially useful as a post-filter to data retrieved by the `hs.http.get` and `hs.http.asyncGet` functions.
http.convertHtmlEntities = function(input)
    return input:gsub("&[^;]+;", function(c) return http.htmlEntities[c] or c end)
end

--- hs.http.encodeForQuery(string) -> string
--- Function
--- Returns a copy of the provided string in which characters that are not valid within an HTTP query key or value are escaped with their %## equivalent.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * originalString - the string to make safe as a key or value for a query
---
--- Returns:
---  * the converted string
---
--- Notes:
---  * The intent of this function is to provide a valid key or a valid value for a query string, not to validate the entire query string.  For this reason, ?, =, +, and & are included in the converted characters.
local encodeForQuery = http.encodeForQuery
http.encodeForQuery = function(...)
    return (encodeForQuery(...):gsub("[%?=&+]", { ["?"] = "%3F", ["="] = "%3D", ["&"] = "%26", ["+"] = "%2B" } ))
end
