--- === hs.grid ===
---
--- Move/resize windows within a grid
---
--- Usage: local grid = require "hs.grid"
---
--- The grid is an partition of your screen; by default it is 3x3, i.e. 3 cells wide by 3 cells tall.
---
--- Grid cells are just a table with keys: x, y, w, h
---
--- For a grid of 2x2:
---
--- * a cell {x=0, y=0, w=1, h=1} will be in the upper-left corner
--- * a cell {x=1, y=0, w=1, h=1} will be in the upper-right corner
--- * and so on...
