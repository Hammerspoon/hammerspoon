/**
 *  In MIKMIDI, MIDI messages are objects. Specifically, they are instances of MIKMIDICommand or one of its
 *  subclasses. MIKMIDICommand's subclasses each represent a specific type of MIDI message, for example,
 *  control change command messages will be instances of MIKMIDIControlChangeCommand.
 *  MIKMIDICommand includes properties for getting information and data common to all MIDI messages.
 *  Its subclasses implement additional method and properties specific to messages of their associated type.
 *
 *  MIKMIDICommand is also available in mutable variants, most useful for creating commands to be sent out
 *  by your application.
 *
 *  To create a new command, typically, you should use +commandForCommandType:.
 *
 *  Subclass MIKMIDICommand
 *  -----------------------
 *
 *  Support for the various MIDI message types is provided by type-specific subclasses of MIKMIDICommand.
 *  For example, Control Change messages are represented using MIKMIDIControlChangeCommand. MIKMIDI
 *  includes a limited number of MIKMIDICommand subclasses to support the most common MIDI message types.
 *  To support a new command type, you should create a new subclass of MIKMIDICommand (and please consider
 *  contributing it to the main MIKMIDI repository!). If you implement this subclass according to the rules
 *  explained below, it will automatically be used to represent incoming MIDI commands matching its MIDI command type.
 *
 *  To successfully subclass MIKMIDICommand, you *must* override at least the following methods:
 *  
 *  - `+supportedMIDICommandTypes:` - Return an array of one or more MIKMIDICommandTypes that your subclass supports.
 *  - `+immutableCounterPartClass` - Return the subclass itself (eg. `return [MIKMIDINewTypeCommand class];`)
 *  - `+mutableCounterPartClass` - Return the mutable counterpart class (eg. `return [MIKMIDIMutableNewTypeCommand class;]`)
 *
 *  Optionally, override `-additionalCommandDescription` to provide an additional, type-specific description string.
 *
 *  You must also implement `+load` and call `[MIKMIDICommand registerSubclass:self]` to register your subclass with
 *  the MIKMIDICommand machinery.
 *
 *  When creating a subclass of MIKMIDICommand, you should also create a mutable variant which is itself
 *  a subclass of your type-specific MIKMIDICommand subclass. The mutable subclass should override `+isMutable`
 *  and return YES.
 *  
 *  If your subclass adds additional properties, beyond those supported by MIKMIDICommand itself, those properties
 *  should only be settable on instances of the mutable variant class. The preferred way to accomplish this is to 
 *  implement the setters on the *immutable*, base subclass. In their implementations, check to see if self is
 *  mutable, and if not, raise an exception. Use the following line of code:
 *
 *		if (![[self class] isMutable]) return MIKMIDI_RAISE_MUTATION_ATTEMPT_EXCEPTION;
 *
 *  For a straightforward example of a MIKMIDICommand subclass, see MIKMIDINoteOnCommand.
