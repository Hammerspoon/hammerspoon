/**
 * This class detects ANRs with a dedicated watchdog thread. The thread schedules a simple block to
 * run on the main thread, sleeps for the configured timeout interval, and checks if the main thread
 * executed this block.
 *
 * @discussion We decided against using a CFRunLoopObserver or the CADisplayLink, which the
 * SentryFramesTracker already uses, because they come with two disadvantages. First, the solution
 * is expensive. Quick benchmarks showed that hooking into the main thread's run loop and checking
 * for every event to process if the main thread executes it in time added around 0,5 % of CPU
 * overhead. Furthermore, if the main thread runs all scheduled events in time, it doesn't mean that
 * there is no ANR ongoing. It could be that the run loop of the main thread is busy for 20 seconds,
 * and it executes all events in time. Instead, what matters is how long the main thread needs to
 * execute a newly added event to the run loop.
