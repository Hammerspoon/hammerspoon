We've now combined all our supported platforms into a single podspec. As a result, we moved our run script to a new location for Cocoapods projects: ${PODS_ROOT}/Fabric/run. To avoid breaking builds that reference the old location of the run script, we've placed this dummy script that calls to the correct location, while providing a helpful warning in Xcode if it is invoked. This bridge for backwards compatibility will be removed in a future release, so please heed the warning!
