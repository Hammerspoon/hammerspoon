--- === hs.screen ===
---
--- Manipulate screens (i.e. monitors)
---
--- The macOS coordinate system used by Hammerspoon assumes a grid that spans all the screens (positioned as per
--- System Preferences->Displays->Arrangement). The origin `0,0` is at the top left corner of the *primary screen*.
--- (Screens to the left of the primary screen, or above it, and windows on these screens, will have negative coordinates)

--- hs.screen.primaryScreen() -> screen
--- Constructor
--- Gets the primary screen
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * An `hs.screen` object
function screen.primaryScreen()
  return screen.allScreens()[1]
end

--- hs.screen.find(hint) -> hs.screen object(s)
--- Function
--- Finds screens
---
--- Parameters:
---  * hint - search criterion for the desired screen(s); it can be:
---   * a number as per `hs.screen:id()`
---   * a string pattern that matches (via `string.match`) the screen name as per `hs.screen:name()` (for convenience, the matching will be done on lowercased strings)
---   * an hs.geometry *point* object, or constructor argument, with the *x and y position* of the screen in the current layout as per `hs.screen:position()`
---   * an hs.geometry *size* object, or constructor argument, with the *resolution* of the screen as per `hs.screen:fullFrame()`
---   * an hs.geometry *rect* object, or constructor argument, with an arbitrary rect in absolute coordinates; the screen
---      containing the largest part of the rect will be returned
---
--- Returns:
---  * one or more hs.screen objects that match the supplied search criterion, or `nil` if none found
---
--- Notes:
---  * for convenience you call call this as `hs.screen(hint)`
---
--- Example:
--- ```lua
--- hs.screen(724562417) --> Color LCD - by id
--- hs.screen'Dell'      --> DELL U2414M - by name
--- hs.screen'0,0'       --> PHL BDM4065 - by position, same as hs.screen.primaryScreen()
--- hs.screen{x=-1,y=0}  --> DELL U2414M - by position, screen to the immediate left of the primary screen
--- hs.screen'3840x2160' --> PHL BDM4065 - by screen resolution
--- hs.screen'-500,240 700x1300' --> DELL U2414M, by arbitrary rect
--- ```

--- hs.screen.screenPositions() -> table
--- Function
--- Returns a list of all connected and enabled screens, along with their "position" relative to the primary screen
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * a table where each *key* is an `hs.screen` object, and the corresponding value is a table {x=X,y=Y}, where X and Y attempt to indicate each screen's position relative to the primary screen (which is at {x=0,y=0}); so e.g. a value of {x=-1,y=0} indicates a screen immediately to the left of the primary screen, and a value of {x=0,y=2} indicates a screen positioned below the primary screen, with another screen inbetween.
---
--- Notes:
---  * grid-like arrangements of same-sized screens should behave consistently; but there's no guarantee of a consistent result for more "exotic" screen arrangements

-- if/when userdata's 'recycling' is addressed, the following note can be added
-- Notes:
--  * To get a specific screen's position in the current layout, you can simply use `pos=hs.screen.screenPositions()[myscreen]`
