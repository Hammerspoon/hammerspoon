# Fabric

## Overview

[Fabric](https://www.fabric.io) provides developers with the tools they need to build the best apps. Developed and maintained by Twitter and the team that built Crashlytics, Fabric provides an easy way to manage all your SDKs so that youâ€™ll never have to worry about tedious configurations or juggling different accounts. We let you get right into coding and building the next big app.
