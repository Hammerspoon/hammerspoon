 @abstract Conversion options for @link pushNSObject:withOptions: @/link and @link toNSObjectAtIndex:withOptions: @/link

   @constant LS_NSNone no options specified, use default beahvior
   @constant LS_NSUnsignedLongLongPreserveBits convert NSNumber that contains an unsigned long long to a lua_Integer (long long) rather than preserve the numerical magnitude with lua_Number (double).  Default is to preserve magnitude when the unsigned long long is greater than 0x7fffffffffffffff.
   @constant LS_NSDescribeUnknownTypes when a date type or sub-type is unrecognized and does not match any defined converter, return a string describing the data (from [NSObject debugDescription] or luaL_tolstring, whichever is appropriate for the initial data type) instead of the default behavior of returing nil for the entire conversion. Not compatible with LS_NSDescribeUnknownTypes.
   @constant LS_NSIgnoreUnknownTypes when a date type or sub-type is unrecognized and does not match any defined converter, return a nil placeholder (from [NSNull null] or lua_pushnil, whichever is appropriate for the initial data type) for the data or sub-component instead of the default behavior of returing nil for the entire conversion. Not compatible with LS_NSDescribeUnknownTypes.
   @constant LS_NSPreserveLuaStringExactly If a Lua string contains character byte sequences which cannot be converted to a proper UTF8 Unicode character, return the string as an NSData object instead of the default lossy behavior of converting invalid sequences into the Unicode Invalid Character code.  You should check your result to see if it is an NSString or an NSData object with the isKindOfClass: message if you select this option. Not compatible with LS_NSLuaStringAsDataOnly.
   @constant LS_NSLuaStringAsDataOnly A lua string is always returned as an NSData object instead of the default lossy behavior of converting invalid sequences into the Unicode Invalid Character code.  Not compatible with LS_NSPreserveLuaStringExactly.
   @constant LS_NSAllowsSelfReference If a lua table contains a self reference (a table value which equals one of tables in which it is nested), allow the same self reference in the NSArray or NSDictionary object being created instead of the defualt behavior of returning nil for the entire conversion.  Note that this option will create an object which likely cannot be fully collected by ARC without additional code due to strong internal references.
   @constant LS_NSRawTables Always convert a Lua table to NSArray or NSDictionary, even if it contains a __luaSkinType field and a registered conversion function for the specified type exists.

#pragma mark - Methods for registering libraries with Lua

/*! @methodgroup Registering module libraries with Lua */

/*!
 @abstract Defines a Lua library and creates a references table for the library
 @discussion Lua libraries defined in C are simple mappings between Lua function names and C function pointers.

 A library consists of a series of Lua functions that are exposed to the user, and (optionally) several special Lua functions that will be used by Lua itself. The most common of these is <tt>__gc</tt> which will be called when Lua is performing garbage collection for the library.
 These "special" functions are stored in the library's metatable. Other common metatable functions include <tt>__tostring</tt> and <tt>__index</tt>.

 The mapping between Lua functions and C functions is done using an array of type <tt>luaL_Reg</tt>

 Every C function pointed to in a <tt>luaL_Reg</tt> array must have the signature: <tt>static int someFunction(lua_State *L);</tt>

 Here is some sample code:
 <pre>@textblock
 static const luaL_Reg myShinyLibrary[] = {
    {"doThing", function_doThing},
    {NULL, NULL} // Library arrays must always end with this
 };

 static const luaL_Reg myShinyMetaLibrary[] = {
    {"__gc", function_doLibraryCleanup},
    {NULL, NULL} // Library arrays must always end with this
 };
