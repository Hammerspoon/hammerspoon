/**
 * This class detects whether a framework belongs to the app or not. We differentiate between three
 * different types of frameworks.
 *
 * First, the main executable of the app, which's name can be retrieved by CFBundleExecutable. To
 * mark this framework as inApp the caller needs to pass in the CFBundleExecutable to InAppIncludes.
 *
 * Next, there are private frameworks embedded in the application bundle. Both app supporting
 * frameworks as CocoaLumberJack, Sentry, RXSwift, etc., and frameworks written by the user fall
 * into this category. These frameworks can be both inApp or not. As we expect most frameworks of
 * this category to be supporting frameworks, we mark them not as inApp. If a user wants such a
 * framework to be inApp, they need to pass the name into inAppInclude. For dynamic frameworks, the
 * location is usually in the bundle under /Frameworks/FrameworkName.framework/FrameworkName. As for
 * static frameworks, the location is the same as the main executable; this class marks all static
 * frameworks as inApp. To remove static frameworks from being inApp, Sentry uses stack trace
 * grouping rules on the server.
 *
 * Last, this class marks all public frameworks as not inApp. Such frameworks are bound dynamically
 * and are usually located at /Library/Frameworks or ~/Library/Frameworks. For simulators, the
 * location can be something like
 * /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/iOS.simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot/System/Library/...
