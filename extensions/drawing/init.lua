---
--- Returns:
---  * The drawing object
---
--- Notes:
---  * This method should only be used on text drawing objects
---  * If the text of the drawing object is currently empty (i.e. "") then style changes may be lost.  Use a placeholder such as a space (" ") or hide the object if style changes need to be saved but the text should disappear for a while.

---
--- Returns:
---  * The drawing object
---
--- Notes:
--- * This method works by rotating the image view within its drawing window.  This means that an image which completely fills its viewing area will most likely be cropped in some places.

---
--- Returns:
---  * The drawing object
---
--- Notes:
---  * No distinction is made between the left, right, or other mouse buttons -- they all invoke the same up or down function.  If you need to determine which specific button was pressed, use `hs.eventtap.checkMouseButtons()` within your callback to check.

--- Moves drawing object below drawing object2, or all drawing objects in the same presentation level, if object2 is not provided.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * Optional drawing object to place the drawing object below.
---
--- Returns:
---  * The `hs.drawing` object

--- hs.drawing.windowBehaviors[]
--- Constant
--- Array of window behavior labels for determining how an hs.drawing object is handled in Spaces and ExposÃ©
---
--- * default           -- The window can be associated to one space at a time.
--- * canJoinAllSpaces  -- The window appears in all spaces. The menu bar behaves this way.
--- * moveToActiveSpace -- Making the window active does not cause a space switch; the window switches to the active space.
---
--- Only one of these may be active at a time:
---
--- * managed           -- The window participates in Spaces and ExposÃ©. This is the default behavior if windowLevel is equal to NSNormalWindowLevel.
--- * transient         -- The window floats in Spaces and is hidden by ExposÃ©. This is the default behavior if windowLevel is not equal to NSNormalWindowLevel.
--- * stationary        -- The window is unaffected by ExposÃ©; it stays visible and stationary, like the desktop window.
---
--- Notes:
---  * This table has a __tostring() metamethod which allows listing it's contents in the Hammerspoon console by typing `hs.drawing.windowBehaviors`.

--- hs.drawing.windowLevels
--- Constant
--- A table of predefined window levels usable with `hs.drawing:setLevel(...)`
---
--- Predefined levels are:
---  * _MinimumWindowLevelKey - lowest allowed window level
---  * desktop
---  * desktopIcon            - `hs.drawing:sendToBack()` is equivalent to this - 1
---  * normal                 - normal application windows
---  * tornOffMenu
---  * floating               - equivalent to `hs.drawing:bringToFront(false)`, where "Always Keep On Top" windows are usually set
---  * modalPanel             - modal alert dialog
---  * utility
---  * dock                   - level of the Dock
---  * mainMenu               - level of the Menubar
---  * status
---  * popUpMenu              - level of a menu when displayed (open)
---  * overlay
---  * help
---  * dragging
---  * screenSaver            - equivalent to `hs.drawing:bringToFront(true)`
---  * assistiveTechHigh
---  * cursor
---  * _MaximumWindowLevelKey - highest allowed window level
---
--- Notes:
---  * This table has a __tostring() metamethod which allows listing it's contents in the Hammerspoon console by typing `hs.drawing.windowLevels`.
---  * These key names map to the constants used in CoreGraphics to specify window levels and may not actually be used for what the name might suggest. For example, tests suggest that an active screen saver actually runs at a level of 2002, rather than at 1000, which is the window level corresponding to kCGScreenSaverWindowLevelKey.
---  * Each drawing level is sorted separately and `hs.drawing:orderAbove(...)` and hs.drawing:orderBelow(...)` only arrange windows within the same level.
---  * If you use Dock hiding (or in 10.11, Menubar hiding) please note that when the Dock (or Menubar) is popped up, it is done so with an implicit orderAbove, which will place it above any items you may also draw at the Dock (or MainMenu) level.
---
---  * A drawing object with a [hs.drawing:setClickCallback](#setClickCallback) function can only reliably receive mouse click events when its window level is at `hs.drawing.windowLevels.desktopIcon` + 1 or higher.

--- hs.drawing:setLevel(theLevel) -> drawingObject
--- Method
--- Sets the window level more precisely than sendToBack and bringToFront.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * theLevel - the level specified as a number or as a string where this object should be drawn.  If it is a string, it must match one of the keys in `hs.drawing.windowLevels`.
---
--- Returns:
---  * the drawing object
---
--- Notes:
---  * see the notes for `hs.drawing.windowLevels`
---  * These levels may be unable to explicitly place drawing objects around full-screen macOS windows

--- hs.drawing:behavior() -> number
--- Method
--- Returns the current behavior of the hs.drawing object with respect to Spaces and ExposÃ© for the object.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * The numeric representation of the current behaviors for the hs.drawing object

--- hs.drawing:setBehavior(behavior) -> object
--- Method
--- Sets the window behaviors represented by the number provided for the window containing the hs.drawing object.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * behavior - the numeric representation of the behaviors to set for the window of the object
---
--- Returns:
---  * The `hs.drawing` object

--- hs.drawing.defaultTextStyle() -> `hs.styledtext` attributes table
--- Function
--- Returns a table containing the default font, size, color, and paragraphStyle used by `hs.drawing` for text drawing objects.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * None
---
--- Returns:
---  * a table containing the default style attributes `hs.drawing` uses for text drawing objects in the `hs.styledtext` attributes table format.
---
--- Notes:
---  * This method returns the default font, size, color, and paragraphStyle used by `hs.drawing` for text objects.  If you modify a drawing object's defaults with `hs.drawing:setColor`, `hs.drawing:setTextFont`, or `hs.drawing:setTextSize`, the changes will not be reflected by this function.

--- hs.drawing.getTextDrawingSize(styledTextObject or theText, [textStyle]) -> sizeTable | nil
--- Function
--- Get the size of the rectangle necessary to fully render the text with the specified style so that is will be completely visible.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * styledTextObject - an object created with the hs.styledtext module or its table representation (see `hs.styledtext`).
---  * textStyle - an optional table containing one or more of the following keys to set for the text of the drawing object (if textStyle is nil or missing, the `hs.drawing` defaults are used):
---
---  The following simplified style format is supported for use with `hs.drawing:setText` and `hs.drawing.setTextStyle`.
---
---  * theText   - the text which is to be displayed.
---  * textStyle - a table containing one or more of the following keys to set for the text of the drawing object (if textStyle is nil or missing, the `hs.drawing` defaults are used):
---    * font      - the name of the font to use (default: the system font)
---    * size      - the font point size to use (default: 27.0)
---    * color     - ignored, but accepted for compatibility with `hs.drawing:setTextStyle()`
---    * alignment - a string of one of the following indicating the texts alignment within the drawing objects frame:
---      * "left"      - the text is visually left aligned.
---      * "right"     - the text is visually right aligned.
---      * "center"    - the text is visually center aligned.
---      * "justified" - the text is justified
---      * "natural"   - (default) the natural alignment of the textâs script
---    * lineBreak - a string of one of the following indicating how to wrap text which exceeds the drawing object's frame:
---      * "wordWrap"       - (default) wrap at word boundaries, unless the word itself doesnât fit on a single line
---      * "charWrap"       - wrap before the first character that doesnât fit
---      * "clip"           - do not draw past the edge of the drawing object frame
---      * "truncateHead"   - the line is displayed so that the end fits in the frame and the missing text at the beginning of the line is indicated by an ellipsis
---      * "truncateTail"   - the line is displayed so that the beginning fits in the frame and the missing text at the end of the line is indicated by an ellipsis
---      * "truncateMiddle" - the line is displayed so that the beginning and end fit in the frame and the missing text in the middle is indicated by an ellipsis
---
--- Returns:
---  * sizeTable - a table containing the Height and Width necessary to fully display the text drawing object, or nil if an error occurred
---
--- Notes:
---  * This function assumes the default values specified for any key which is not included in the provided textStyle.
---  * The size returned is an approximation and may return a width that is off by about 4 points.  Use the returned size as a minimum starting point. Sometimes using the "clip" or "truncateMiddle" lineBreak modes or "justified" alignment will fit, but its safest to add in your own buffer if you have the space in your layout.
---  * Multi-line text (separated by a newline or return) is supported.  The height will be for the multiple lines and the width returned will be for the longest line.

--- hs.drawing:wantsLayer([flag]) -> object or boolean
--- Method
--- Gets or sets whether or not the drawing object should be rendered by the view or by Core Animation.
---
--- Parameters:
---  * flag - optional boolean (default false) which indicates whether the drawing object should be rendered by the containing view (false) or by the Core Animation interface (true).
---
--- Returns:
---  * if `flag` is provided, then returns the drawing object; otherwise returns the current value
---
--- Notes:
---  * This method can help smooth the display or small text objects on non-Retina monitors.
