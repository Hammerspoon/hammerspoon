--- Core Hammerspoon functionality

return {setup=function(...)
  local modpath, prettypath, fullpath, configdir, docstringspath, hasinitfile, autoload_extensions = ...
  local tostring,pack,tconcat,sformat=tostring,table.pack,table.concat,string.format
  -- setup core functions

  os.exit = hs._exit

  --- hs.configdir
  --- Constant
  --- A string containing Hammerspoon's configuration directory. Typically `~/.hammerspoon/`
  hs.configdir = configdir

  --- hs.shutdownCallback
  --- Variable
  --- An optional function that will be called when the Lua environment is being destroyed (either because Hammerspoon is exiting or reloading its config)
  --- Notes:
  ---  * This function should not perform any asynchronous tasks
  ---  * You do not need to fastidiously destroy objects you have created, this callback exists purely for utility reasons (e.g. serialising state, destroying system resources that will not be released by normal Lua garbage collection processes, etc)
  hs.shutdownCallback = nil

  --- hs.docstrings_json_file
  --- Constant
  --- A string containing the full path to the `docs.json` file inside Hammerspoon's app bundle. This contains the full Hammerspoon API documentation and can be accessed in the Console using `help("someAPI")`. It can also be loaded and processed by the `hs.doc` extension
  hs.docstrings_json_file = docstringspath

  --- hs.showError(err)
  --- Function
  --- Shows an error to the user, using Hammerspoon's Console
  ---
  --- Parameters:
  ---  * err - A string containing an error message
  ---
  --- Returns:
  ---  * None
  ---
  --- Notes:
  ---  * This function is called whenever an (uncaught) error occurs or is thrown (via `error()`)
  ---  * The default implementation shows a notification, opens the Console, and prints the error message and stacktrace
  ---  * You can override this function if you wish to route errors differently (e.g. for remote systems)

  function hs.showError(err)
    hs._notify("Hammerspoon config error") -- undecided on this line
    --  print(debug.traceback())
    print(err)
    hs.focus()
    hs.openConsole()
    hs._TERMINATED=true
  end

  function hs.assert(pred,desc,data)
    if not pred then error([[
  Internal error: please open an issue at
  https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/issues/new   and paste the following stack trace:

  Assertion failed: ]]..desc..'\n'..(data and hs.inspect(data) or ''),2)
    end
  end

  --- hs.toggleConsole()
  --- Function
  --- Toggles the visibility of the console
  ---
  --- Parameters:
  ---  * None
  ---
  --- Returns:
  ---  * None
  ---
  --- Notes:
  ---  * If the console is not currently open, it will be opened. If it is open and not the focused window, it will be brought forward and focused.
  ---  * If the console is focused, it will be closed.
  function hs.toggleConsole()
    local console = hs.appfinder.windowFromWindowTitle("Hammerspoon Console")
    if console and (console ~= hs.window.focusedWindow()) then
      console:focus()
    elseif console then
      console:close()
    else
      hs.openConsole()
    end
  end

  --- hs.rawprint(aString)
  --- Function
  --- The original Lua print() function
  ---
  --- Parameters:
  ---  * aString - A string to be printed
  ---
  --- Returns:
  ---  * None
  ---
  --- Notes:
  ---  * Hammerspoon overrides Lua's print() function, but this is a reference we retain to is, should you need it for any reason
  local rawprint,logmessage = print,hs._logmessage
  hs.rawprint = rawprint
  function print(...)
    rawprint(...)
    local vals = pack(...)

    for k = 1, vals.n do
      vals[k] = tostring(vals[k])
    end

    local str = tconcat(vals, "\t") .. "\n"
    logmessage(str)
  end
  function hs.printf(fmt,...) return print(sformat(fmt,...)) end


  --- hs.execute(command[, with_user_env]) -> output, status, type, rc
  --- Function
  --- Runs a shell command, optionally loading the users shell environment first, and returns stdout as a string, followed by the same result codes as `os.execute` would return.
  ---
  --- Parameters:
  ---  * command - a string containing the shell command to execute
  ---  * with_user_env - optional boolean argument which if provided and is true, executes the command in the users login shell as an "interactive" login shell causing the user's local profile (or other login scripts) to be loaded first.
  ---
  --- Returns:
  ---  * output -- the stdout of the command as a string.  May contain an extra terminating new-line (\n).
  ---  * status -- `true` if the command terminated successfully or nil otherwise.
  ---  * type   -- a string value of "exit" or "signal" indicating whether the command terminated of its own accord or if it was terminated by a signal (killed, segfault, etc.)
  ---  * rc     -- if the command exited of its own accord, then this number will represent the exit code (usually 0 for success, not 0 for an error, though this is very command specific, so check man pages when there is a question).  If the command was killed by a signal, then this number corresponds to the signal type that caused the command to terminate.
  ---
  --- Notes:
  ---  * Setting `with_user_env` to true does incur noticeable overhead, so it should only be used if necessary (to set the path or other environment variables).
  ---  * Because this function returns the stdout as it's first return value, it is not quite a drop-in replacement for `os.execute`.  In most cases, it is probable that `stdout` will be the empty string when `status` is nil, but this is not guaranteed, so this trade off of shifting os.execute's results was deemed acceptable.
  ---  * This particular function is most useful when you're more interested in the command's output then a simple check for completion and result codes.  If you only require the result codes or verification of command completion, then `os.execute` will be slightly more efficient.
  hs.execute = function(command, user_env)
    local f
    if user_env then
      f = io.popen(os.getenv("SHELL")..[[ -l -i -c "]]..command..[["]], 'r')
    else
      f = io.popen(command, 'r')
    end
    local s = f:read('*a')
    local status, exit_type, rc = f:close()
    return s, status, exit_type, rc
  end

  --- hs.dockIcon([state]) -> bool
  --- Function
  --- Set or display whether or not the Hammerspoon dock icon is visible.
  ---
  --- Parameters:
  ---  * state - an optional boolean which will set whether or not the Hammerspoon dock icon should be visible.
  ---
  --- Returns:
  ---  * True if the icon is currently set (or has just been) to be visible or False if it is not.
  ---
  --- Notes:
  ---  * This function is a wrapper to functions found in the `hs.dockicon` module, but is provided here to provide an interface consistent with other selectable preference items.
  hs.dockIcon = function(value)
    local hsdi = require("hs.dockicon")
    if type(value) == "boolean" then
      if value then hsdi.show() else hsdi.hide() end
    end
    return hsdi.visible()
  end

  --- hs.help(identifier)
  --- Function
  --- Prints the documentation for some part of Hammerspoon's API and Lua 5.3.  This function is actually sourced from hs.doc.help.
  ---
  --- Parameters:
  ---  * identifier - A string containing the signature of some part of Hammerspoon's API (e.g. `"hs.reload"`)
  ---
  --- Returns:
  ---  * None
  ---
  --- Notes:
  ---  * This function is mainly for runtime API help while using Hammerspoon's Console
  ---
  ---  * You can also access the results of this function by the following methods from the console:
  ---    * help("identifier") -- quotes are required, e.g. `help("hs.reload")`
  ---    * help.identifier.path -- no quotes are required, e.g. `help.hs.reload`
  ---
  ---  * Lua information can be accessed by using the `lua` prefix, rather than `hs`.
  ---    * the identifier `lua._man` provides the table of contents for the Lua 5.3 manual.  You can pull up a specific section of the lua manual by including the chapter (and subsection) like this: `lua._man._3_4_8`.
  ---    * the identifier `lua._C` will provide information specifically about the Lua C API for use when developing modules which require external libraries.
